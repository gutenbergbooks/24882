<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> National Society of the Colonial Dames of America have formed the
laudable habit of illustrating the colonial period of United States
history, in which they are especially interested, by published volumes
of original historical material, previously unprinted, and relating to
that period. Thus in the course of years they have made a large
addition to the number of documentary sources available to the student
of that period. First they published, in 1906, in two handsome
volumes, the <i>Correspondence of William Pitt, when Secretary of State,
with Colonial Governors and Military and Naval Commanders in America</i>,
edited by the late Miss Gertrude Selwyn Kimball, containing material
of great importance to the history of the colonies as a whole, and of
the management of the French and Indian War. Next, in 1911 and 1914,
they published the two volumes of Professor James C. Ballagh's
valuable edition of the <i>Letters of Richard Henry Lee</i>. Then, in 1912,
they brought out, again in two volumes, the <i>Correspondence of
Governor William Shirley</i>, edited by Dr. Charles H. Lincoln, and
illustrating the history of several colonies, particularly those of
New England, during the period of what in our colonial history is
called King George's War. More recently, in 1916, the Society
published an entertaining volume of hitherto unprinted <i>Travels in the
American Colonies</i>, edited by Dr. Newton D. Mereness.</p>

<p>It was resolved that the next volume after these should be devoted to
documents relating to maritime history. In proportion to its
importance, that aspect of our colonial history has in general
received too little attention. In time of peace the colonists, nearly
all of whom dwelt within a hundred miles of ocean or tidewater,
maintained constantly a maritime commerce that had a large importance
to their economic life and gave employment to no small part of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
population. In time of war, their naval problems and dangers and
achievements were hardly less important than those of land warfare,
but have been far less exploited, whether in narrative histories or in
volumes of documentary materials. Accordingly the Society's Committee
on Publication readily acceded to the suggestion that a volume should
be made up of documents illustrating the history of privateering and
piracy as these stand related to the life of America during the
colonial period&mdash;for it is agreed that few aspects of our maritime
history in that period have greater importance and interest than these
two. In some of our colonial wars, as later in those of the Revolution
and of 1812, American privateering assumed such proportions as to make
it, for brief periods, one of the leading American industries. We
cannot quite say the same concerning American piracy, and indeed it
might be thought disrespectful to our ancestors&mdash;or predecessors, for
pirates mostly died young and left few descendants&mdash;but at least it
will be conceded that piracy at times flourished in American waters,
that not a few of the pirates and of those on shore who received their
goods and otherwise aided them were Americans, that their activities
had an important influence on the development of American commerce,
and that documents relative to piracy make interesting reading.</p>

<p>It is a matter for regret and on the editor's part for apology, that
the book should have been so long in preparation. Work on it was begun
prosperously before our country was engaged in war, but the "spare
time" which the editor can command, always slight in amount, was much
reduced during the period of warfare. Moreover, the Society, very
properly, determined that, so long as war continued, the publication
of their volumes and the expenditures now attendant upon printing
ought to be postponed in favor of those patriotic undertakings,
especially for the relief of suffering, which have made their name
grateful to all lovers of the Navy and in all places where the
<i>Comfort</i> and the <i>Mercy</i> have sailed.</p>

<p>It may be objected against the plan of this book, that privateering
and piracy should not be conjoined in one vol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>ume, with documents
intermingled in one chronological order, lest the impression be
created that piracy and privateering were much the same. It is true
that, in theory and in legal definition, they are widely different
things and stand on totally different bases. Legally, a privateer is
an armed vessel (or its commander) which, in time of war, though
owners and officers and crew are private persons, has a commission
from a belligerent government to commit acts of warfare on vessels of
its enemy. Legally, a pirate is one who commits robbery or other acts
of violence on the sea (or on the land through descent from the sea)
without having any authority from, and independently of, any organized
government or political society. (Fighting and bloodshed and murder,
it may be remarked by the way, though natural concomitants of the
pirate's trade, are not, as is often supposed, essentials of the crime
of piracy.) But wide as is the legal distinction between the
authorized warfare of the privateer and the unauthorized violence of
the pirate, in practice it was very difficult to keep the privateer
and his crew, far from the eye of authority, within the bounds of
legal conduct, or to prevent him from broadening out his operations
into piracy, especially if a merely privateering cruise was proving
unprofitable. Privateering was open to many abuses, and it was not
without good reason that the leading powers of Europe, in 1856, by the
Declaration of Paris, agreed to its abandonment.</p>

<p>The object of the following collection of documents is not to give the
whole history of any episode of piracy or of the career of any
privateer, but rather, by appropriate selection, to illustrate, as
well as is possible in one volume, all the different aspects of both
employments, and to present specimens of all the different sorts of
papers to which they gave rise. Nearly all the pieces are documents
hitherto unprinted, but a few that have already been printed, mostly
in books not easy of access, have been included in order to round out
a story or a series. The collection ends with the termination of the
last colonial war in 1763. Presented in chronological order, it may
have a casual, as it certainly has a miscellaneous, appearance. But
variety was intended,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span> and on closer inspection and comparison the
selection will be seen to have a more methodical character than at
first appears, corresponding to the systematic procedure followed in
privateering, in prize cases, and in trials for piracy.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of war in which Great Britain was involved, it was
customary for the King to issue a commission to the Lord High Admiral
(or to the Lords of the Admiralty appointed to execute that office)
authorizing him (or them) to empower proper officials, such as
colonial governors, to grant letters of marque, or privateering
commissions, to suitable persons under adequate safeguards.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
Lords of the Admiralty then issued warrants to the colonial governors
(see <a href="#DOC_127">doc. no. 127</a>), authorizing them to issue such commissions or
letters of marque. A specimen American privateering commission may be
seen in <a href="#DOC_144">doc. no. 144</a>; a Portuguese letter of marque, and a paper by
which its recipient purported to assign it to another, in docs. <a href="#DOC_14">no. 14</a>
and <a href="#DOC_15">no. 15</a>. Royal instructions were issued to all commanders of
privateers (<a href="#DOC_126">doc. no. 126</a>), and each was required to furnish, or
bondsmen were required to furnish on his behalf, caution or
security<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for the proper observance of these instructions and the
payment of all dues to the crown or Admiralty. Relations between the
commander and the crew, except as regulated by the superior authority
of these instructions and of the prize acts or other statutes, were
governed by the articles of agreement (<a href="#DOC_202">doc. no. 202</a>) signed when
enlisting.</p>

<p>These were the essential documents of a privateering voyage. There
would probably be also accounts for supplies, like John Tweedy's very
curious bill for medicines (<a href="#DOC_158">doc. no. 158</a>), and accounts between crew
and owners (<a href="#DOC_146">doc. no. 146</a>), and general accounts of the voyage
(<a href="#DOC_159">doc. no. 159</a>). There might be an agreement of two privateers to cruise
together and divide the spoil (<a href="#DOC_160">doc. no. 160</a>). There might even be a
journal of the whole voyage, like the extraordinarily interesting
journal kept on the privateer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span> <i>Revenge</i> by the captain's
quartermaster in 1741 (<a href="#DOC_145">doc. no. 145</a>), one of the very few such
narratives preserved. Other documents of various kinds, illustrating
miscellaneous incidents of privateering, will be found elsewhere in
the volume.</p>

<p>Both privateers and naval vessels belonging to the government made
prize of ships and goods belonging to the enemy, but many questions
were certain to arise concerning the legality of captures and
concerning the proper ownership and disposal of ships and goods. Hence
the necessity for prize courts, acting under admiralty law and the law
of nations. The instructions to privateers required them (see <a href="#DOC_126">doc. no.
126</a>, section III.) to bring captured ships or goods into some port of
Great Britain or her colonial dominions, for adjudication by such a
court. In England, it was the High Court of Admiralty that tried such
cases. At the beginning of a war, a commission under the Great
Seal,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> addressed to the Lords of the Admiralty, instructed them to
issue a warrant to the judge of that court, authorizing him during the
duration of the war to take cognizance of prize causes. After 1689, it
was customary to provide for trial of admiralty causes in colonial
ports by giving to each colonial governor, in addition to his
commission as governor, a commission as vice-admiral. Before 1689,
this was done in a few instances, chiefly of proprietary colonies, the
earliest such instance being that exhibited in our <a href="#DOC_1">doc. no. 1</a>; but in
the case of colonies having no royal governor (corporation colonies)
we find various courts in that earlier period exercising admiralty
jurisdiction (docs. <a href="#DOC_8">no. 8</a>, <a href="#DOC_25">no. 25</a>, <a href="#DOC_48">no. 48</a>, and <a href="#DOC_105">no. 105</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_746">note 1</a>). From
Queen Anne's reign on (<a href="#DOC_102">doc. no. 102</a>), jurisdiction in prize causes was
conferred, as in the case of the judge of the High Court of Admiralty
in London, by warrant (<a href="#DOC_182">doc. no. 182</a>) from the Lord High Admiral or
Lords of the Admiralty pursuant to the commission issued to them, as
stated above, at the beginning of the war. In <a href="#DOC_116">doc. no. 116</a> we see the
judge of the High Court of Admiralty expressing the belief that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
would be better if all prizes were brought to his court in London for
adjudication, but the inconvenience would have been too great.</p>

<p>The governor's commission as vice-admiral, issued (after 1689, at any
rate) under the great seal of the High Court of Admiralty, gave him
authority to hold an admiralty court in person. Often the governor was
not well fitted for such work, though not often so frank as Sir Henry
Morgan (<a href="#DOC_46">doc. no. 46</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_361">note 1</a>) in admitting his deficiencies. As
admiralty business increased, it became customary to appoint admiralty
judges to hold vice-admiralty courts in individual colonies, or in
groups of colonies. Sometimes, especially in the earlier period, they
were commissioned by the governor of the colony acting under a warrant
from the Lords of the Admiralty (<a href="#DOC_69">doc. no. 69</a>) empowering him so to do;
more often they were commissioned directly by those lords, under the
great seal of the Admiralty. <a href="#DOC_180">Doc. no. 180</a> is a commission of the
former sort, <a href="#DOC_181">doc. no. 181</a> of the latter. When war broke out, authority
to try prize cases was conveyed, as above, to the vice-admiral, the
vice-admiralty judge, and their deputies.</p>

<p>In the trial of a prize case, the first essential document was the
libel (docs. <a href="#DOC_99">no. 99</a>, <a href="#DOC_128">no. 128</a>, <a href="#DOC_165">no. 165</a>, <a href="#DOC_184">no. 184</a>, and <a href="#DOC_188">no. 188</a>), by which
claim was laid to ship or goods. Witnesses were examined, chiefly by
means of the systematic series of questions called standing
interrogatories (<a href="#DOC_183">doc. no. 183</a>). Their testimony, taken down in written
depositions, constitutes much the largest class of documents in this
volume. Most narratives of privateering or of piracy are found in the
form of depositions. Reports of trials, embracing proceedings and
documents and testimony, are found in docs. <a href="#DOC_128">no. 128</a>, <a href="#DOC_143">no. 143</a>, and
<a href="#DOC_165">no. 165</a>; sentences or decrees of the judge in docs. <a href="#DOC_143">no. 143</a>, <a href="#DOC_150">no. 150</a>, and
<a href="#DOC_155">no. 155</a>; inventories of prizes in docs. <a href="#DOC_33">no. 33</a> and <a href="#DOC_161">no. 161</a>; an account
of sales in <a href="#DOC_186">doc. no. 186</a>.</p>

<p>If a party to a prize appealed from the sentence of the vice-admiralty
court (docs. <a href="#DOC_151">no. 151</a> and <a href="#DOC_196">no. 196</a>), he was required to give bond
(<a href="#DOC_152">doc. no. 152</a>) for due prosecution of the appeal in England. From 1628 to
1708 such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span> appeals were heard by the High Court of Admiralty; after
1708 they went to a body of privy councillors specially commissioned
for the purpose, called the Lords Commissioners of Appeal in Prize
Causes (see <a href="#DOC_151">doc. no. 151</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_1098">note 1</a>). A specimen of a decree of that
tribunal reversing the sentence of a colonial vice-admiralty court is
in <a href="#DOC_195">doc. no. 195</a>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Piracy being from its very nature a less formal proceeding than
privateering, there are fewer formal documents to present as essential
to its history. In the seventeenth century, there are instances of
trials for piracy by various courts: <i>e.g.</i>, the Court of Assistants
in Massachusetts in 1675 (<a href="#DOC_41">doc. no. 41</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_200">note 1</a>) and the Massachusetts
Superior Court in 1694 (<a href="#DOC_56">doc. no. 56</a>, <a href="#Footnote_2_399">note 2</a>). But the regular method,
which came to prevail, was trial by special commissions appointed for
the purpose, similar to those which were appointed for the trial of
pirates in England by virtue of the statute 28 Henry VIII. c. 15
(1536). We have such a colonial commission, appointed by the governor,
in <a href="#DOC_51">doc. no. 51</a> (1683). In 1700 the statute 11 and 12 William III. c. 7
extended to the plantations the crown's authority to appoint such
commissions (see docs. <a href="#DOC_104">no. 104</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_740">note 1</a>, <a href="#DOC_106">no. 106</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_751">note 1</a>, and <a href="#DOC_201">no. 201</a>).
A curious signed agreement to commit piracy will be found in <a href="#DOC_50">doc. no.
50</a>; indictments for that crime in docs. <a href="#DOC_56">no. 56</a>, <a href="#DOC_119">no. 119</a>, and <a href="#DOC_120">no. 120</a>;
partial records of trials in docs. <a href="#DOC_112">no. 112</a>, <a href="#DOC_113">no. 113</a>, and nos. <a href="#DOC_119">119</a>-<a href="#DOC_122">122</a>.
A full account of an execution, explicit enough to satisfy the most
morbid curiosity, is presented in <a href="#DOC_104">doc. no. 104</a>. Nos. <a href="#DOC_123">123</a> and <a href="#DOC_124">124</a> are
formal bills for the execution, the digging of the graves, and the
cheering drams which the executioners found needful after their grisly
work.</p>

<p>But if American colonial piracy presents a smaller array of legal
documents than American colonial privateering, it makes up for it by
its rich abundance of picturesque narrative and detail. The pieces
here brought together show us piracy off Lisbon and in the East Indies
and at Madagascar, at Portobello and Panama and in the South Sea, in
the West Indies, and all along the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
to the coast of Guiana. They exhibit to us every relation from that of
the most innocent victim to that of the most hardened pirate chief.
They make it clear how narrow was sometimes the line that divided
piracy and privateering, and how difficult it must have been to learn
the truth from witnesses so conflicting and of such dubious
characters, testifying concerning actions of lawless men in remote
seas or on lonely shores.</p>

<p>Most of the pirates famed in story, who had anything to do with
colonial America, appear in one way or another in these papers. On the
history of Henry Every, for instance, and even on the oft-told tale of
William Kidd, not a little new light is cast. Kidd's letters from
prison, the letter and petitions of his wife, the depositions of
companions, the additional letters of Bellomont, make the story live
again, even though no new evidence appears that is perfectly
conclusive as to the still-debated question of his degree of guilt.
The wonderful buccaneering adventures of Bartholomew Sharp and his
companions, 1680-1682, at the Isthmus of Panama and all along the west
coast of South America, are newly illustrated by long anonymous
narratives, artless but effective. And indeed, to speak more
generally, it is hoped that there are few aspects of the pirate's
trade that are not somehow represented in these pages.</p>

<p>At least it will not be denied that the documents, whether for piracy
or for privateering, show a considerable variety of origins. Their
authors range from a Signer of the Declaration of Independence to an
Irishwoman keeping a boarding-house in Havana, from a minister of
Louis XIV. or a judge of the High Court of Admiralty to the most
illiterate sailor, from Governor John Endicott, most rigid of
Puritans, to the keeper of a rendezvous for pirates and receiver of
their ill-gotten goods. Witnesses or writers of many nationalities
appear: American, Englishmen, Scots, Irishmen, Frenchmen, Dutchmen,
Spaniards, a Portuguese, a Dane or Sleswicker, a Bohemian, a Greek, a
Jew. The languages of the documents are English, French, Dutch,
Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin. Though none of them are in German or
by Germans, not the least interesting pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span> in the volume are those
(docs. <a href="#DOC_43">no. 43</a>, <a href="#DOC_48">no. 48</a>, and <a href="#DOC_49">no. 49</a>) which show a curious connection of
American colonial history with the very first (and characteristically
illegal and unscrupulous) exploits of the Brandenburg-Prussian navy.</p>

<p>The range of repositories from which the documents have been procured
is also considerable. Many were found in the state archives of
Massachusetts, many in the files of the Supreme Judicial Court for
Suffolk County, many in the collections of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, others in the archives of Rhode Island and New
York, in the office of the surrogate of New York City, and in the New
York Public Library. A very important source of material,
indispensable indeed for certain classes of document, was the records
and papers of the vice-admiralty courts of the colonial period.
Extensive portions still remain in the case of four of these courts,
at Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston (see the first
foot-notes to docs. <a href="#DOC_126">no. 126</a>, <a href="#DOC_184">no. 184</a>, <a href="#DOC_165">no. 165</a>, and <a href="#DOC_106">no. 106</a>,
respectively). A large number of the documents, larger indeed than
from any other repository but one, were drawn from the inexhaustible
stores of the Public Record Office in London, namely, from the
Admiralty and Colonial Office Papers. Others came from the Privy
Council Office; a few, but among them two of the longest and most
interesting, from among the Sloane and Harleian manuscripts in the
British Museum; one whole group from the Rawlinson manuscripts in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford. Three of the Kidd documents were obtained
from among the manuscripts of the Duke of Portland at Welbeck Abbey.
Several of the pieces, and a number of lesser extracts used in
annotations, were taken from colonial newspapers, and two from printed
books not often seen.</p>

<p>Archivists and librarians have assisted the editor with their
customary and never-failing kindness. It is a pleasure to express his
gratitude to Mr. J.J. Tracy and Mr. John H. Edmonds, former and
present archivists of Massachusetts, Mr. Herbert O. Brigham of the
Rhode Island archives, Mr. A.J.F. van Laer and Mr. Peter Nelson of
those of New York; to Mr. Worthington C. Ford and Mr. Julius H.
Tut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>tle of the Massachusetts Historical Society; to Hon. Charles M.
Hough, judge of the United States Circuit Court in New York; to Miss
C.C. Helm of his office; to the late Miss Josephine Murphy, custodian
of the Suffolk Files; to Miss Mabel L. Webber, secretary and librarian
of the South Carolina Historical Society; to Mr. Victor H. Paltsits of
the New York Public Library; to Rev. Richard W. Goulding, librarian to
the Duke of Portland; and to the authorities of the Public Record
Office, the Privy Council Office, the British Museum, and the Bodleian
Library. Special thanks are due to the officials of three libraries in
which the work of annotation was mostly done&mdash;the Library of Congress,
that of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and that of Bowdoin
College. On a few nautical points the editor had the advice of his old
friend the late Captain Charles Cate of North Edgecomb, Maine. And
especially he has to thank the chairman of the Committee on
Publication, Mrs. Charles E. Rieman, for her interest in the work and
for the exemplary patience with which she has borne the delays in its
completion.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to say that the spelling of the originals has
been carefully preserved; it is hoped that it would not be thought to
be that of the editor. The punctuation of the originals has not been
deemed equally sacred. In general, it has been reproduced, but where
small alterations would make the sense clear to the modern reader but
could not change it, or where that same effect would be produced by
introducing punctuation-marks, which writers nearly illiterate often
omitted entirely, it has seemed the part of good sense to make
reading-matter readable. Also, names of vessels have been uniformly
italicized even when not underscored in the original manuscripts.
Dates previous to 1752 are old-style dates unless, as in the case of
Dutch or French documents, new style is indicated.</p>

118. This document and the next take us back to an almost-forgotten
colonial experiment of the English Puritans, contemporary with their
undertakings in New England but far removed from them in locality. Old
Providence Island&mdash;to be distinguished from New Providence (Nassau) in
the Bahamas&mdash;is an isolated little island in the western Caribbean
lying off the coast of Nicaragua. It now belongs to Colombia, and is
often called Santa Catalina. In 1630 a company of English investors,
desiring to found a Puritan colony, and also to oppose Spain in the
Caribbean, obtained from Charles I. a patent for a large area
including Providence and other islands. John Pym was their leading
member. The history of their colony is interestingly recounted in
Professor A.P. Newton's <i>The Colonizing Activities of the English
Puritans</i> (New Haven, 1914). The colony became merely a base for
privateering against the Spaniards, who conquered and suppressed it in
1641. Thomas Gage, who passed by the island in a Spanish ship in 1637,
says, "The greatest feare that I perceived possessed the Spaniards in
this Voyage, was about the Island of Providence, called by them Sta.
Catarina or St. Catharine, from whence they feared lest some English
Ships should come out against them with great strength. They cursed
the English in it, and called the Island the den of theeves and
Pirates." <i>The English American, or A New Survey of the West-India's</i>
(London, 1648), p. 199. For the whole matter of West Indian
buccaneering, see Miss Violet Barbour's article, "Privateers and
Pirates of the West Indies", in the <i>American Historical Review</i>, XVI.
529-566.</p></div>

treasurer, a Yorkshire squire, was a conspicuous Puritan and an
intimate friend of Pym. Robert Rich (1587-1658), second earl of
Warwick, afterward a chief leader of the Puritans in the Civil War,
and lord high admiral under Parliament, had before this been
conspicuous in privateering and colonial ventures, and president of
the Council for New England. Viscount Saye and Sele (1582-1662) and
Lord Brooke (1608-1643), eminent Puritan and Parliamentarian lords,
are best known in American history as patentees of the Saybrook
colony, but were much more deeply interested in the Providence Island
venture. Edward viscount Mandeville (courtesy title borne until his
father's death in 1642) is better known as the second earl of
Manchester (1602-1671), the celebrated Parliamentarian general. John
Pym needs no identification. John Gourdon or Gurdon was an East
Anglian squire, neighbor of John Winthrop of Groton.</p></div>

<p>[<i>February</i>] 13. Wee hadd an alarme this morneinge, and in regard that
the sayle that wee made came to an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span> Anchor close without our Rocks
called the Breakers, wee sone found that she was a stranger and in
perill: wherupon I sent out two shalopes well manned and followed
myself in the thirde: and by the waye wee mett with her bote being
only a Canow in which all of her men wer come off from her and left
her alone; But wee tooke two of her men backe with us to the shypp;
and sent two of my Botes to bring her into the Harbour;<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the which
was done: Wee founde her to be a Spanish Frigate, taken by a man of
Warre of Flushinge off of Cuba. she was laden with mantega de
Porco,<a name="FNanchor_3_14" id="FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_14" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Hides and tallowe; their resolution was to have carried her
to St. Christophers,<a name="FNanchor_4_15" id="FNanchor_4_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_15" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and ther to have sold her Goods, but being not
able to fetch itt, she was forced to beare up for our Iland; and but
for us had wracked upon our rocks; shee was manned with eight men; and
the man of warre that tooke her haveinge dispatched her as he thought
for St. Christophers, remained upon the Coast of Hispaniola to looke
out for more purchase:<a name="FNanchor_5_16" id="FNanchor_5_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_16" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and in the meantime, little knows what is
become of his Prize.</p>

<p>14. I dined at Captain Morgan's. After dinner the Councell of Warre
wer assembled at my house; wher some propositions wer considered off
touchinge the new come Dutche; as alsoe about some redresses in
respect of wronngs pretended to be offred by our Pillageinge seamen.</p>

<p>15. I was att Warwicke Fort<a name="FNanchor_6_17" id="FNanchor_6_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_17" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> this morneinge, wher I called a
Counsell of warre; and the new come in Dutche presented a coppy of
their Commission signed by the Prince of Orange and the Dutche West
India Company. After dinner being newly returned home, wee hadd an
alarme, upon the discovery of a sayle; and I went presently out in my
shalope and sent Captaine Axe out in his shalope to make a discoverye
upon her; she proved to be another smale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> man of warre of Holland
which had bin long upon the coast of the terra firma;<a name="FNanchor_7_18" id="FNanchor_7_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_18" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and hadd
gotten nothinge; towards the eveninge she came to an Anchor in our
Harbour. This vessell comeinge to the Ronchadores (it being only a
desolate barren rocky sande twentie leagues to the eastwards of
Providence, which is the nearest land unto itt)<a name="FNanchor_8_19" id="FNanchor_8_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_19" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> found ther an
Englishman the which with some others being in a smale frigate wer
shypwracked upon itt, some of them gott awaye upon two rafts of which
the one of them was never hearde off; Thoes upon the other raft wer
driven upon the maine-land of the West-Indies, and soe att last gott
home. This man with some others remained upon the sande and rocks;
wher att last all of them died save this man only; who after he hadd
remained ther two yeares and a halfe of which for ten monethes space,
after the deathe of all the rest, he lived solitarily and all alone,
being only fedd with such sea foules as resorted to the place, and
sometimes some fish, he was thus taken and brought home unto us in
good healthe and very lusty.</p>

<p>16. I went very early this mornenige to the greate Baye, wher my
worcks went forwards well and almost to my wish. In the afternoone
being returned home, I spent some houres in the hearinge of divers
controversies amongst the Inhabitants. Towards night the Commander of
the Dutche Vessel that came into our Harbour the daye before presented
himself unto me and shewed me his Commission signed by the Prince of
Aurenge:<a name="FNanchor_9_20" id="FNanchor_9_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_20" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> His errand hither was to find and stoppe a leake; haveinge
bin foure or five monethes upon the coast, and gotten noethinge. This
morneing also, another of the new Companyes was in their Armes, upon
the great Baye; and exercised by Captain Carter<a name="FNanchor_10_21" id="FNanchor_10_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_21" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in my presence,
and did well.</p>

<p>17. Upon this Lorde's daye I was in the morneinge and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> eveninge at Mr.
Sherrard's Churche,<a name="FNanchor_11_22" id="FNanchor_11_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_22" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who preached unto us, at both times. After the
afternoone's sermon, the poore man that was soe hapely recovered from
the Ronchadores, was introduced by Mr. Sherrarde to make a publicke
thanksgiveinge to God for his deliverance with a confession in
generall tearmes of his former vicious life, and a promise of future
amendment. An act very commendable in itselfe, and a Course fully
approvable: Though itt now brought to every man's minde and
observation, that whereas the apparent evidence of God's mercye in as
highe or higher a nature hadd been manifested towards Captain Axe and
his company in his escape from the enemie, to thoes five persons that
came safe unto us, in an extreme leakinge bote, from St. Christophers;
And towards the fortie nine persons that arrived safely with us from
the Barbadoes;<a name="FNanchor_12_23" id="FNanchor_12_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_23" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> And all this done within the space of foure
monethes; that none of all this should have bin remembered by Mr.
Sherrard, in the same kinde; as if the safe-being of this one only
man, had either bin of more remarkableness in itselfe, or of more
acceptableness with him than all the others putt togither....</p>

<p>21. Early this morneinge I went out in my shalope to Darlies Fort<a name="FNanchor_13_24" id="FNanchor_13_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_24" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
to looke out for the vessells that wer made the eveninge before and by
sunne riseinge wee againe made them five leagues out to sea standeinge
in with our Harbour; and by ten of the clocke they came ther to an
Anchor: and one of them proved to be the Pinnace called the <i>Queene of
Bohemia</i><a name="FNanchor_14_25" id="FNanchor_14_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_25" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that I had sent out about five weekes before to looke out
for Purchase upon the coasts of the maine; the other was a Spanish
Frigate which she hadd made her Prize. I dined this daye at a
weddinge.</p>

<p>22. The Captaine of our last arrived Pinnace came unto me and
certified me concerneinge his voiage, and the take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>inge of his Prize;
and I gave him some Advices about the orderinge of every man's shares:
And upon this daye all the montega de Porco, and the Tallow that came
in the first Dutche was sold to the people att reasonable rates....</p>

<p>25. One of our new Companys was exercised upon this daye, by Captaine
Hunt;<a name="FNanchor_15_26" id="FNanchor_15_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_26" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> I went aborde our new prize, to sett downe orders, upon the
Breakeinge of Bulke; And the Prize Goods began this morneinge to be
unshypped, into our Store House. I hadd many Bussinesses brought afore
me this daye, and found trouble ynough in decideinge of them.</p>

<p>26. Our new erected Company of Voluntiers exercised this morneinge,
att our new exerciseinge place, and all the Captaines dined with me:
In the afternoone, I called a Counsell of warre, where orders wer sett
downe and given to the Captaines of the Fortes about makeing of all
shotts att the comeinge in of shypps: Witnesses wer also examined in
the Court of Admiraltie<a name="FNanchor_16_27" id="FNanchor_16_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_27" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> about the new come in Prize, and a
preparation made to an Adjudication. I hearde, determined and appeased
divers differences, which might have produced ill bloud.</p>

<p>27. Very early this morneinge, I found worcke ready for me to heare
and decide divers complaincts between the Inhabitants. Some of the
Counsell of Warre dined with me; presently after dinner I caused a
Proclamation pro forma to be made by sound of the Drumme, concerninge
the Bussinesse of our new gotten prize: viz, That if anyone could make
a claime to any of the said Prize goods or saye anything why
adjudication of her being lawfull Prize should not be granted; they
should come in by such a daye and should be heard accordinge to
Justice. This afternoone all our Prize Goodes being landed, I went to
the Store-house to see equall divisions made; And the Lordes
fiftes<a name="FNanchor_17_28" id="FNanchor_17_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_28" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> wer first layde aside; and then my dues as Admirall, and
Captaine Axe's as Vice Admirall; and then some shares wer delivered
accordinge to every man's part, to the common marriner[s];<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> and all
the Tobacco belonginge to them, was shared and delivered.</p>

<p>28. We wer all this daye busied att the Store-House in the shareinge
of the dues to the Shyp-Company, out of the Prize Goods; and in
proportioninge the Honorable Companye's Fiftes; and mine owne Admirall
duties, and the Vice Admirall's, Captain Axe....</p>

<p>[March] 2. The Commanders and merchants of the Dutch men of warre
dined with me this daye: our new prize Frigate by the presumption of
her master in takeinge awaye without leave an Anchor and a Cable from
her, which he claimed to be his due, and which she rode by in the
Harbour, was driven ashore; for which fact he was cited to an Admirall
Court....</p>

<p>4. I called a Court of Admiraltie this morneinge; and empannelled
twelve seamen, to deliver their verdict, concerninge a misdeameanour
committed by a master of a shyp, in takeinge awaye a Cable and an
Anchor from a vessell rideinge in the Harbour; wherby the said vessell
was driven on grounds and in perill to be lost: but thes Jurors proved
themselves soe absurde and ignorant as sone made me finde the miserie
of trialls in these dayes by such kinde of men: And it now produced an
Order in a session of the Counsell of Warre in the afternoone, whereby
all future crimes and commissions of this nature wer made punishable
another waye. A new officer in the nature of a fiscall or Advocate<a name="FNanchor_18_29" id="FNanchor_18_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_29" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
in our Court of Admiraltie was elected and sworne this daye.</p>

<p>5. The Prize Vessell that was driven aground was gotten off safe this
morneinge, wherby the penalties inclifted<a name="FNanchor_19_30" id="FNanchor_19_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_30" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> by the verdict in the
Admiraltie Court in case it hadd perished, wer taken off.</p>

Gov. Nathaniel Butler's "Diary of my Present Employment", extracts

of a minor colonial governor with problems of privateering, and
incidentally somewhat of his daily life. The whole journal runs from
February 10, 1639, to May 3, 1640, and is largely occupied with an
unsuccessful privateering voyage in the Caribbean which the governor
undertook on his own account. England was not at war in February,
1639, but war had long existed between Spain and the Netherlands, and
the depredations carried out from Providence were sure ultimately to
provoke Spanish reprisals. It was moreover almost an accepted maxim
that there was "No peace beyond the Line", <i>i.e.</i>, west of the prime

<p>Appeared before me Jacob Hendricksz Kip,<a name="FNanchor_2_42" id="FNanchor_2_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_42" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> authorized clerk to the
Honorable Director General and Honorable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> Council of New Netherland,
Antony Leon, native of Majorca, 26 years old, Spaniard, and Fyck
Herry, native of Castlehaven in Ireland, about 21 years old,
passengers, who came from Captain Flip Drest's bark into the bark of
Willem Albertsz Blaeuvelt, who testify, witness, and declare, in lieu
and on offer of oaths, at the request of the joint owners of the
frigate <i>La Garce</i>, of which the above-named Willem Blaeuvelt was
captain, that it is true and certain that they, the deponents, being
in the said Captain Blaeuvelt's bark, saw, and they recollect very
well, that upon July 18, 1649, in the bay of Campechie,<a name="FNanchor_3_43" id="FNanchor_3_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_43" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> there came
in the evening a ship which they thought to be the bark or prize of
Blaeuvelt, whereupon Blaeuvelt immediately made sail, and turned to
the leeward in order that they might the better make her out. The said
Blaeuvelt ran up the Prince's flag above and at the stern, not waiting
for her, but doing his best to get away from her. About eleven o'clock
at night she came up to him, when Blaeuvelt's quartermaster, named
Gerrit Hendricksz, called: "Flip, Flip, mate Flip", but received no
answer and then cried out, "Strike for the Prince of Orange!"<a name="FNanchor_4_44" id="FNanchor_4_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_44" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> [The
Spaniard] answered, "Strike for the King of Spain!" and immediately
fired with cannon four shots. The fifth piece failed to go off. The
sixth shot struck Blaeuvelt's ship, without his having made any
preparations [to fire]; said Blaeuvelt resolved to sail close to the
wind in order to get to his people. All which we deponents aforesaid
declare to be true and certain, offering on demand to confirm the same
by oath. This 27th of September, 1649, on the Island of Manhattan in
New Netherland. Signed with a mark of the following shape,
<img src="images/sidewaysh.png" width="17" height="19" alt="sideways H" title="sideways H" />,
against which is written, "This is the mark of Fyck

<p>To all whom these presents may concerne, greeting etc.</p>

<p>Know yee that the ship called the <i>holy gost</i> of Amsterdam of the
burthen about 160 tune beeing taken as a prize and carried away out of
the Roade of the Iland of Barbados by some seamen and some planters
and Inhabitants of the said Iland, the said Ship and company in their
sayling Faling upon the coasts of new England were mett with at sea
about 50 leagues from our harbor of Boston in great extremity, wanting
provision, by a ship bound from London to our Ports whoe supplied them
for there present need and pilatted them into one of our harbors
called Natasket<a name="FNanchor_2_51" id="FNanchor_2_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_51" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> where there is not a fort to bring a ship under
Command. the Councell hearing of such a ship lying there sent to the
Capt and company of the said ship and invited them to come into our
harbor at Boston, they being afrade so to doe by reason (as the
Councell was enformed) they were told that if they came into the
harbor the Capt and Company should bee imprisoned and the ship seased.
afterwards the Capt coming a shore, as alsoe some of the company, the
Capt was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> arrested and some of the company were imprisoned, who were
examined apt [apart] what ship it was they had taken and whence shee
was, whither of Holland or of Spayne,<a name="FNanchor_3_52" id="FNanchor_3_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_52" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or wheather they had used any
cruelty to any of the Company they tooke, either by wounding, killing
or setting any of them ashore upon any Iland or other place to the
endangering of there lives. they all agreed in one relation that no
such thing was done by them or any man hurt, And there beeing not any
person heere to enforme against the[m] and they making it appeare by a
dutch certificate under the seale of Amsterdam and by other dutch
writings w'ch are extant with us found in the seisd ship, that shee
was a dutch ship of Amsterdam sett out by diverse Marchants of that
citty, the councell released the said Capt and the rest w'ch had beene
inprisoned, And sent to the rest of the ships company that they might
freely come into our harbor, where they should have trafficke and
protection from all Injuries and liberty of trade with any of our
inhabitants as any other ships whatsoever, the ship afterwards came
into Salem harbor,<a name="FNanchor_4_53" id="FNanchor_4_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_53" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And the Governor gave order to have the whole
Cargo of goods to be brought ashore, that theire might bee a true
Invoyce taken thereof, that the state of England<a name="FNanchor_5_54" id="FNanchor_5_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_54" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> might have the
tenth. And the rather because it was reported to be a vessell of great
treasury And the account thereof might be expected from the goverment,
being brought in to this Jurisdiction, And to the end there might be
the better satisfaction given to such as might inquier after it. In

<p>Theare arived some sixe mo. since before this Iland a spannish ship
belonging to Tennarife (one of the Canary Ilands) Commanded by
Emanuell Rodriges, Capt. thereof, who having mett with much contrary
weather in theire voiage homewards wer necessitated to put for this
place, and being before the Iland sent in theire request to have
libertie to wood and water. accordingly it was graunted unto them,
with Assurance of receiving like protection, freedome, and libertie in
our ports, as any other Nation in league and Amitie with the
Commonwealt[h] of England, which gave them Incouridgment to bring
theire shipp into harbor within Command of our forts, and having
staied and Refreshed themselves some three weeks time and taken in
such necessaryes and provicions as they needed, whiles the Comander
with the major parte of his men were on shoare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> abo[ut] theire
dispatches, the said ship was Unhappily surprized in the harbor by a
wicked deboist<a name="FNanchor_2_60" id="FNanchor_2_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_60" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Crew of persons, who getting aboard and by force
suppressed those few seamen which were in the shipp, Cutt the Cables
and sett saile.</p>

<p>Assoone as the surprise was discovered some shott were made at them,
but theire resolution to Carry so desperate an Attempt (knowing w't
the end would have binn had they fayled therein) and sensiblenesse [?]
in theire dispatch to gett the ship without Command, as also the night
Coming on, and having the Advantage of winde and Currant, no meanes
Could be used to recover the shipp Againe, by which action the
Comander, with his men, who but a little before were possessed (as
well of theire owne as others Interested) with very Considerable
estates, were left on shoare to be Releived by our charitie.</p>

<p>The Inhabitants of this Iland with myself Cannot but have a very great
Resentment of so vile an Act, which hath Reflected so much not only
uppon Authoritie but the Iland in Generall, and may heareafter reflect
to the prejudice of particcular persons heare who trade at the Canary
Ilands.</p>

<p>Wee have lately understood these Robbers by fained pretenses and
discourses, to Coulor theire Action have endeavored to shelter
themselves under your Authoritie in New England, but its hoped and
beleived that such persons will not be harboured, nor such Actions
Countenanced by you there. if they should it may proove for the future
of evill consequence to this Colonie. it was least of all suspected
theire Confidence would have led them thither, otherwise wee should
from hence have ere this requested your Assistannce for stoping the
shipp and goods, and persons of those Robbers, untill the parties
concerned therein might have Intelligence of theire being in New
England, there to prosecute for theire rights;</p>

<p>The Capt. of the said ship with some others of the Compa. went hence
for England hoping there to meete with them, others of them are gonn
to some of the leiward Ilands, and some to the Canaries. assoone as
Intelligence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> cann be given to the proprietors at tennarife, you will
I judge have some one from thence, to prosecute for theire shipp and
goods.</p>

<p>The persons who Committed this Robberie being thorough theire
deboistnes brought into Considerable engagements to severall of the
Inhabitants of this Iland, had long before sought waies to make
escapes from of this place, to Avoide theire Confinement which the
lawe would have forced them unto for sattisfaccion of theire just
debts; and had not this ship presented, theire Attempts would have
binn to have zeased on some other, as since hath binn prooved, which
might as well have binn some Vessell heare of your Collony, as any
other; theire example have binn encouradgement to others to Attempt
the like, but wee are, and shall be as dilligent to prevent the same
as possible wee may. if all or some of the cheife of those Robbers (if
they are still with you), were sent hither that exemplary Justice
might be Inflicted on them, it maybe a meanes to terrify others from
such actions for the future.</p>

<p>What Justice you please to execute in this particcular, will not only
be well resented by us heare; but also thankefully acknowledged and
greately vindicate the Justice of your Authoritie against such as
otheruise may be apt to blemish the same.</p>

<p>Since the Surprisall of said shipp here arived another vessell from
the Canarie Ilands, to offer trade with the Inhabitants, who
notwithstanding the Assurance they receaved from me of freedom and
protection therein, yet afterwards being Informed of the Aforesaid
action would not trust themselves amongst us but departed; which doe
tend much to the prejudice of the Collonie. I shall not further
enlarge at present but referr all to your Consideracion; and Commend
you to the Almighty in whom I Rest</p>

<p>Att A Counsell Called by the Governor on occasion of a letter sent
from the Governor of Berbadoes to the Governor heere respecting the
prizemen and held at Salem the 24th of January, 1653.<a name="FNanchor_2_62" id="FNanchor_2_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_62" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>After the Counsell had Considered of that letter they Ordered that the
Secretary should forthwith transcribe true Coppies of the originall
and translacion of the Dutch Certifficat and the other Dutch writting
found in the shipp called the <i>holy ghost</i>, and presented by Capt.
Robt. Harding to the Counsell, Attested by the Secretary and sent to
the Gov'nor and Counsell at the berbadoes, And further Ordered that
the Secretary may give true coppies thereof to the Capt. or any other
of the prizemen or any other that shall desier them;</p>

<p>And though by what the Governor of Berbadoes hath hitherto Certefied
to us, it does not legally appeare that the vessell was or is a
spannish vessell, but the Contrary rather seemeth unto us by the dutch
Certifficat and other writting sealed and the Inscription on the
sterne of hir <i>De heyly<a name="FNanchor_3_63" id="FNanchor_3_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_63" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Gheest</i>, with the picture of the dove and
burden of the ship concurring with them, yett for these severall
reasons, viz. 1. Becawse it cann be no Injury to Capt. Robt. Harding,
Left. Thom. Morrice, and that company to Justify theire oune act at
Berbadoes, (if it were a lawfull act). 2. Because there is
probabillitie, some evidence appearing, that severall of the shipps
former company that was aboard are missing, wch were not brought into
this Jurisdiccion, what is become of them cannot so well be cleered,
nor the Case triable any where so well as at the Berbadoes where the
fact was donne. 3. Becawse Capt. Harding, Left. Morrice and the rest,
as is suspected, have not discovered all the treasure that was in the
shipp and thereby have deceaved the Commonwealth of England (In Case
it should proove a pricze)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> which cannot be cleered so well, any where
as at Berbadoes, who have as wee are Informed inquired of hr [?] the
value of the prize, and the Rather becawse they broke bulke at
Pemequid, out of our Jurisdiccion,<a name="FNanchor_4_64" id="FNanchor_4_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_64" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and that after they had our
order, which they seemed to decline by theire Accepting proteccion
from Capt. Gilbert Crane, as appeares by proofe, who was in our
harbors under the Imploiment of the Parliament of England for masts
and Tarre.<a name="FNanchor_5_65" id="FNanchor_5_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_65" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Itt is therefore Ordered that the Capt. Robt. Harding, Left. Thomas
Morris and the rest of that company now in hold and such as shall be
taken heere after shall with all conveniency be sent to the Berbadoes
and In the meane time Remaine in prison, unlesse the Counsell shall
take further order.</p>

<p>Itt is further Ordered that Capt. Robert Harding, Left. Thomas Morris
and Henry Cowes shall, when Capt. Jno. Allen or any other that shall
first be Ready to sett saile to the Berbadoes, be delivered safe
aboard to him or them, by him or them to be delivered to the Governor
and Counsell at Berbadoes, And It is left to any three of the
majestrates to send the rest by such conveyances as they shall Judge
meete.</p>

<p>And that the Secretary shall from the Counsell give a strict charge to
the keeper of the prison to secure them in prison so as they escape
no[t] as he will Answer it on his utmost perrill.</p>

<p>That being at Jamaica about the moneth of January last past, there

Hispaniola and Jamaica by John Morrice Captn. of the <i>Virgin Queene</i>
(an english man of war), who putt two or three of his men aboad to
bring her into Jamaica harbor, hee with his man of war bearing her
Company neere to the harbour; when the sd <i>blew dove</i> had bin three or
foure daies at Jamaica there was a Court of Admiralty appointed for
the triall of the sd <i>Blew-dove</i>, it being expected by the sd Captn.
Morrice and Company that the sd Ship would have been a prize to them,
and their great Argument was that they were sailing towards Cuba
before they had seized them, and that they were laden with am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>munition
and goods sutable to the spanish trade: but uppon triall in the Court,
their billes of Lading appeared that they were bound to Jamaica, their
cocketts and dispatches being cleere from the Kings Custome-house at
Dover; this deponent speaking in Court to Sr Charles Littelton (then

declare them to be a free ship, and to have their liberty of trade as
any other Ship whatsoever that was then in the Harbour; And further
saith that the aforesd Captn. John Morrice told this deponent that hee
had hoped to have had a good prize of the <i>blew-dove</i>, but hee gott
nothing of them but an English Ensigne, and a hogshead of strong
beare, and that the sd <i>Blew-dove</i> came in with English colours, and

<p>A Declaration of some Occurrents that happened to us in our late
voiadge from London in the Ship <i>Barkely</i> of the saide port, Nicholas
Prynne Commander, intended for Virginia, Anno 1672/3.</p>

<p>On the twelfth Aprill 1673 being in saide Ship about the Lattitude of
the Capes of Virginia about 80 Leagues distant, wee saw a sail towards
Evening, and being in want of provitions, seeing her to be a Fly
boate,<a name="FNanchor_2_170" id="FNanchor_2_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_170" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> made towards her and came up with her about Eight a clock
and hailed them asking them of whence theire Ship. they answered of
Falmoth. wee ask't them from whence they came. they answered from
Virginia, and called mee by my name and asked mee how I did. wee asked
them what places they loaded at. they answered, in Petuxin River.<a name="FNanchor_3_171" id="FNanchor_3_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_171" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
wee told them wee wanted some provitions. they answered us if we would
hoise out our Boate and come on boarde, they would spare us water and
other provitions what they could. in order thereunto wee did soe, and
I being desired by the Master and Merchant<a name="FNanchor_4_172" id="FNanchor_4_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_172" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to goe on board with the
Boate to Endeavor to gett what provitions I could, our Marchant who
was the owner also desired mee to stay, and hee and the Doctor would
goe with mee as soon as they had sealed theire let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>ters. Our Master
not having ended his writing the marchant desired him to goe on board
with us also and to finish his letter there, and accordingly with
three more Seamen wee went on board saide Ship, and when wee came
there founded severall Dutchmen on board who had the Command of her,
they having lately taken her from the English. the Ship was called the
<i>Providence</i>, belonging to Falmoth, Thomas Radden having been lately
master of her. the saide Dutchman Surprized six of us and kept us
prisoners and sent one of our Company with three Dutchmen on board our
Ship, who lay by us till the next morning. then the Dutch Commander
comanded our Ships' Boate to come on board his Ship againe, which
accordingly they did, hee promising our merchant to take out our goods
and to give us our Ship againe, in order whereunto hee provided one
hogshead of bread to have given us as hee saide and tooke our marchant
with him and went on board our Ship, and about halfe an hour after our
Ship made sail and Steered to the westward: and then the Dutch men put
us who formerly belonged to her down into the hole and made sail after
the saide Ship for about two houres, and seeing they could not come up
with her stood on theire course againe to the Eastward, and by
receiving advice from those Englishmen that were at liberty were
combined together for them to make way for our coming up and soe to
rush out upon the Dutchmen at once and to Subdue them, for the
rescueing of ourselves and Ship, which with god's blessing wee
Effected, without loss of life or bloodshed to any, and then agreed
among our Selves to come away with saide Ship to New England, which
accordingly wee did and after Eleven days passage by reason of
contrary wind and foggy weather arrived in Piscataquay River on the
23th Aprill 1673.</p>

<p>A Declaracion of some Occurrents that happened us in our late voiadge
from Falmouth intended for Virginia in the Ship <i>Providence</i> of
Falmoth, Anno 1672/3, Thomas Radden Commander.</p>

<p>About the 12th November 1672 wee sailed from Falmoth in the aforesaid
Ship to Plimouth for convoy and there lay till the 15th January
following, when wee sailed under convoy with a fleete of about 90
sail. our convoy went with us about 80 Leagues to the Westward of
Silly,<a name="FNanchor_2_174" id="FNanchor_2_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_174" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> then with about ten sail more were parted from the fleet and
were making the best Emprovement of winde and weather to gaine our
port till the 4th Aprill following, when wee between the houres of
four and six in the morning saw a Sail upon our weather quarter. wee
made what sail wee could, hee giving us chase, in about two houres hee
came up with us, showed us Dutch colours, comanded us by the lee and
to strike our Topsaile and ancient:<a name="FNanchor_3_175" id="FNanchor_3_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_175" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> wee seeing of him to bee a man
of War of Force could make no resistance against him, did accordingly:
then the Capt. himself came aboard of us with twelve Dutch men more,
showed us his Commission Signed by the Prince of Orange, for the
taking of English Ships: the Capt. was named Cornelius Linquoint and
commanded the Ship in English called the <i>Commonwealth</i>, of 20 peice
of Ordnance. then hee tooke our master, merchant and ten seamen more
out of our Ship and left seven of us aboard and soe went aboard his
man of war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span> againe and ordered the Dutch Steersman, whome hee left
with Eleven Dutchmen more on board of our Ship, to Steere after the
man of War, and in case wee should bee parted by weather to Saile with
our Ship to the Groyne in Galecia, as the said Steeresman informed
mee: the same night following wee lost the man of War&mdash;the said Capt
having told mee that if wee kept Company while the next morning hee
would take the Goods out of our Ship on board the man of war and give
us our own Ship againe, but having lost Company of him in the night,
wee bore up the helme to the Eastward, intending for the Groyne, as
the Steersman informed mee. having plied too and againe 6 days hoping
to meete with the man of war againe, two days after wee bore up wee
saw a sail which made towards us, being about 3 Leagues from us.
betweene six and eight aclock in the evening they came up with us, and
hailed us asking whence wee were. The Dutch Steersman, standing with a
laden pistol presented to my breast, commanded mee to answer them in
those words he should dictate to mee, bid mee answer them, of Falmoth,
and to tell them wee came from Petuxine River in Virginia, and if they
wanted anything if they would hoise out theire Boat and Come aboard
wee would supply them, upon which they hoised out theire Boat and the
Master, Merchant, Mate, Doctor and two seamen came on board in the
Boate, and after they had entred our Ship the Dutchmen Surprized them
and sent three Dutchmen on board theire Ship and the Ship staied by us
all the night. next morning the Dutchmen intending to goe on board
commanded the said Shipps boats on board, who came accordingly, and
the Dutch Skipper went on board the aforesaid Ship intending to take
out her goods and put on board of our Ship, as hee saide, in order
whereunto hee tooke the merchant along with him. about halfe an hour
after, the said Ship made sail and steered to the westward. wee in our
Ship making Sail followed them between two and three houres, and
finding wee could not come up with her left our chase and stood to the
Eastward againe, there being five Englishmen belonging to the saide
Ship prisoners in our Ships hold. about six houres after, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> same
day, wee Englishmen that were at liberty, by writing to them in the
hold, conspired together with them to lett them come up and soe to
rush all out together upon the Dutch men and if wee could Subdue them
to rescue ourselves and Ship, which accordingly with gods' blessing
wee effected without any loss of life or shedding of blood and soe
intended to New England, being afraide to goe for Virginia leaste wee
should meete the man of War againe and being unable to carry the Ship
home for England, and after eleven days lying at Sea by reason of
foggy weather and contrary windes wee arrived at Piscataquay in New

<p>The Declaration of Thomas Mitchell of Maulden Fisherman Humbly
sheweth, That the said Mitchell beinge hired in October last both
himself and the Barque whereof he was a part owner, for three moneths
certaine and foure uncertaine upon a Tradeing voyage to the Eastward
as farre East as a Plais called Siccanecto<a name="FNanchor_2_201" id="FNanchor_2_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_201" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in the Bottome of the
Bay of Fundi by Captaine Peter Roderius and other of the Privateers,
as by a Charter Party under their hands and seales more att Large it
doth and may appeare, had nott any thought or suspition that the said
Privateers would have taken any things from any man wrongfully, they
before they went out severall times promiseinge the contrary (which if
they should deny may be made to appeare). Butt when sd. Privateers
came to the Eastward, instead of complyinge with their Charter Party
or makeinge good their Promise, forced the sd. Michell to carry them
whither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span> they Pleased, and although the sd. Michell was very earnest
Seaverall times with them to be discharged from their service,
proffering them at Pemequid,<a name="FNanchor_3_202" id="FNanchor_3_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_202" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> before he went out of this
Jurisdiction, to loose the hire of his vessell and with more they
desired rather [than] to proceed any further in said voyage, as
Lieutt. Gardner<a name="FNanchor_4_203" id="FNanchor_4_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_203" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and his sonnes can testifie, And when he came backe
from Pemequid, had he nott, the winde being Faire, been forced away
before he could speak with Lieutt. Gardner, he might have had
sufficient testimony from them of his unwillingnesse to proceed any
further with them; Neither did the said Michell give his consent to
their takeinge of any vessell or goods from any Person but as farr as
in him lay and as much as he durst did oppose the same: Neither had
the said Michell any share or part of any of the said goods that the
aforesd Privateer tooke, nor had any hand in the takeing of either
vessells or goods, butt was alwayes agt. such their proceedings, and
when they came as farr East as Naskeague,<a name="FNanchor_5_204" id="FNanchor_5_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_204" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> when the Privateers spake
of goeing over the Bay of Fundi he told them he had rather give them a

Robert Wills may appeare which was sworne by The Worsp'll Mr.
Stoughton.<a name="FNanchor_6_205" id="FNanchor_6_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_205" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Nevertheless they forced the said Michell to goe over
the Bay with them, tellinge him they would carry him and his vessell
wherever they pleased, And Being at Tuskett Islands,<a name="FNanchor_7_206" id="FNanchor_7_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_206" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the said
Michell demandinge his hyre, telling them the time was expired that
was mentioned in the Charter Party, and that he desired to goe home to
looke after his familie and to pay his Merch'ts that had betrusted
him, And withall he forewarned them for weighing his An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>chors for he
would stay noe longer in their service; But Richard Fowler,
threatninge that he would make a hole through his skinne if hee did
nott hold his tongue, went and, whether he would or nott, weighed his
Anchors and forced him to goe backe to Machias; The said Privateers by
their uncivill Carriage did make the said Michell soe weary of the
voyage that if he could have gotten an opportunity he would have come
away with his vessell and left them there, though he had lost all his
hire and what also he carried out with him; Now the Premisses beinge
considered by this Hon'ble Court, he hopes they will have soe much
Charitie for him as to conclude him nott guilty of those actions that
are laid to his Charge: The Just and Righteous determinations whereof
he Leaves to the Wisdome and Clemencie of this Hon'ble Court, and is

in the <i>Records of the Court of Assistants</i>, I. 34-39, 42. The chief
originator of this episode of piracy was a Dutch captain from Cura&ccedil;ao,
Juriaen Arentsen. In 1674, when a state of war existed between France
and the Netherlands, he captured the French forts at Castine and St.
John, and took possession of the region as "New Holland." Then, "at
the <i>Bear</i> in Boston," he gave some sort of commission to another
Dutchman or Fleming, Peter Rodrigo or Rodriguez, to John Rhodes of
Boston, and others, under which they proceeded in the piratical manner
described in documents <a href="#DOC_41">41</a> and <a href="#DOC_42">42</a>. The Court of Assistants had now, by
a law passed in December, 1673, been fully authorized to act as a
court of admiralty (which hitherto it had done without formal
authorization); sitting as such, May 17-June 17, 1675, it condemned
Peter Rodrigo, Dutchman, John Roads, late of Boston, Peter Grant,
Scotchman, Richard Fowler and Randolph Judson, Englishmen, for piracy,

<p>To the Hono'rd Court of Assistants Now Sitting in Boston The
Declaration of Edward Youring of Boston, Fisherman, Humbly Showeth:</p>

<p>Thatt whereas the said youring being in October last past, both
himselfe and the Barke whereof the said youring was part owner, and
being hyred upon A leading Voyage, so farr Easterly as A Place caulled
Zecganickto nere the botom of the Bay of Fundy (and noe further), by
Capt. Peter Rodregross and Company; As by A Charter Partie, Refferance
being had thereunto, more fully may Appear; and allso will therein
Declare thatt I your Poore and Humble Declarant Edward Youring had not
the Least Intention of anything thereby but onely and honestly to
Improve both myselfe and my Interest in the foresaid Barque, in an
honest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span> Lawfull way; And it being well knowen and seen, both in Towne
or else where wherever my caulling haith Led mee, thatt I have been
according to my Capassetye and Abillity an Industreous hard Laberar,
whereby I mought gitt wherewith to mentayne my Famely, which in a
measure hayth been sumthing Comefortably untell now (through the
goodness of God), nor I have not at all been wanting to take the best
paynes I could for an honest Livelyhood, both for my selfe and my
Familie, I not being so Ignorant but thatt by Instructyans and good
Examples being thereby rightlie informed, thatt hee is worse than an
Infidle thatt shall not provide for his Familie, etc.; I Doe Declare
in the presence of God and Your Hon'rs this Day that, through God's
goodness to me, I am Conscious unto my owne Innocency, and am truly
free from thatt Reporte of my being guiltie of Pyracy or being A
pyorett, nither ever had I the Least thought nor suspition thatt those
persons which Carryed them selves so fairly to me whilst that I was in
Boston with them, would have caryed it so much contrary to whatt they
promised to me before they went from hence; And thatt was thatt they
would not meddle, nor take either vessells or goods from any English
man, as may Appeare by severel testimonys; whereupon I did proced upon
the said Voyage, upon Monthly Wages. And wee being come as farr East
as Casco Bay, then the Privateers (though much against my minde and
will) they wentt on Shoare and brought on Board of us severall Sheepe
which belonged to the inhabitants of thatt place, where upon I did so
farr show my dislike to the Privateers for soe doeing that I tould
them thatt I protested against their Actions in that way; where upon
they did not only revile and use opprobius and reproachfull words to
me for my declayring my minde to them, but they allso threated to
strycke me and being so threatened forced me to Silence, and they also
forced me to goe further upon the said voyage; and when wee arrived so
farr East as Pemmaquid I tooke so much notice of the debaucherie of
the Privateers thatt I thought in my selfe thatt the voyage was not
like only to be unproffitable but allso troublesome and uncomfortable,
whereupon I desired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> to be cleared from them, but I being one thatt
was bound by charter partie was forced to goe further East with them;
and Comeing to a Place caulled Knoskeegg,<a name="FNanchor_2_208" id="FNanchor_2_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_208" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> there wee mett with Capt.
Roades and the Privateers tooke him aboard of our vessell, and after
some stay there the wind being Contrary, notwithstanding they went to
turne it out and as they ware turning out, I Edward Youring spoke to
Thomas Mitchell whoe was then at helme, desireing him to beare up the
helme and to goe no further with them, and I tould the sayd Mitchell
my reason was because I heard them say thay would take George
Manning<a name="FNanchor_3_209" id="FNanchor_3_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_209" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the Vessell if they could meet with him, and one of the
Privateers, by name Randler Judgson, came to me as I was speaking to
Mitchell to beare up the helme, sweareing thus or this effect: "God
damne me, Youring or Mitchell, speake another word of bearing up the
Helme and Ile knock out your Braines with a hand speake", etc.;
furthermore I the sayd Youring haveing no way to Escape from them was
forced to Stay Longer with them, but at Length Comeing to a Harbour
further East, wee spieing a vessell at an Anchor, Capt. Rodregrose
commanded Thomas Mitchell to Steer right with her, and Comeing up with
her Rodregross bid them Amaine<a name="FNanchor_4_210" id="FNanchor_4_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_210" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> for the Prince of Orainge; whareupon
they lowred out their Annchor and it proved to be George Manning; then
I the said Youring, haveing heard Rodregross and the Privateers say
whatt they Intended to doe if they meett with Manning, I intreated
them not to take him but to lett him goe peaceably with whatt hee had,
and onely give him warning for the future; but Rodregross instead of
Complying with my request blamed me much for speak[ing] against
takeing of him, and forthwith went on board and tooke a way his
peltery; and the same Afternoone made prize, both of vessell and
goods, after wh. I Edward Youring Speakeing in the behalf of Manning,
Capt. Rodregross tooke doune his pistol, wch generally he kept loaden
by him, and presented it to me, and had not Capt. Roades whch satt by
Layd his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span> hand upon it, turnning of it away from me, I had then been
shott. and the next Night following Petter Grant one of the Privateers
made a writeing, and being very earnest with me to sett my hand to it,
toulde me it would be no damage to me to sett my hand as a Witness; I
the said Youring, being Ignorant of such things and not knowing what
was in it, I did Sett my hand to it, but no otherwayes butt as A
wittness (the which I did by reason of my being in feare of my life,
if I should have denyed to have done it), and soon after the
Pryvat[eer] [<i>torn</i>] had been at Mayhchyous<a name="FNanchor_5_211" id="FNanchor_5_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_211" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Laded the goods
they tooke from George Manning, they went to St. Johns, wheare they
had not been above three or fower howers, as I judge, before thatt
there caime into the Harbor a vessell from the Sea and came to an
Anchor about a mile distant from us. then the said Rodregross
Commanded twoe boates to be manned to cary him and his Company, and
coming nere to the vessell, he bid them A Mayne for the Prince of
orainge, and Some in the vessell knowing him desired him to come
aboard, And when he came aboard Rodregross Commanded them to weigh
Anchor and to Come and Ride by him; and thatt Night Capt. Rodregross
kept possession of [<i>torn</i>] himself and the next day commanded his
boat from his own vessell, and Commanded George Walton, master of the
said vessell,<a name="FNanchor_6_212" id="FNanchor_6_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_212" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to deliver their Beaver and Moose, wch after search
made in the hold he tooke and Carryed it away, and I the said Youring
shewing my dislike as much as I darst in my opposeing Rodregross, upon
which and because I would not give my consent to goe over the Bay of
Fundee, I being one thatt was ingaged by Charter partie to the
Contrarie, and soone affter one of the Privateers struke me many
blowes upon my backe and Sides with a long knife Like a Short Hangger,
which brused me very mutch, and the same night being a very could
night in the latter eand of Dicember Last, the sayd Privateer thatt
hett me turned me ashoare, wheare I was like to be Starved wth could.
The next day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> following, I being very ill and very sore with the
blowes I recd the evenning before, and after the morning was a little
passed, with much intreetye I prevailed to git libertie to goe aboard
to gitt some Releife. And after they had forced Thomas Mitchell and
myselfe to goe over the Bay of Fundee, as wee Returned backe wee put
into Maychyas, and Standing into the harbor wee saw a vessell under
Duch collors standing out; which when wee came nere unto proved to be
George Mannings vessell; whoe as soone as hee came up with us, haveing
gotten to Windward of our Vessell, poured a Volley of Shott in upon us
with Dutch coullors flying, and presently affter wee saw a vessell
with French Coullors, upon which wee concluded All to be French and
thatt wee ware betrayed and should bee taken; thereupon Capt.
Rodregross Commanded every man to his Arms and to fight for his life.
But as soone as Capt. Mosely<a name="FNanchor_7_213" id="FNanchor_7_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_213" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Came up with us, hee haveing the
English Coullors out, Hee bid us A Maine for the King of England, and
I myselfe Loured the Maine Sayle three or foure foot doune, at which
Capt. Rodregross was very angry with me and Commanded me to hoyse it
againe, which I Refused to doe; and there upon I went forward and Laye
before the windles tell the vessell was taken; And when the Capt.
yeelded, I Edward Youringe Lett fall the Anchor; I being very glad
that I was freed from the Bondage and Slavery I was in untell the
vessell was taken by Capt. Moseley; I being all the voyage Comanded,
as occasion presented, to goe a Shoare with John Farmer to cott wood
and fetch watter to carry aboard; notwithstanding one halfe of the
vessell was my owne; and also I stand Still ingaged for one halfe of
the Cargoe thatt was Carryed out from Boston.</p>

<p>Now all these premises being searyously pondred by this honord Courte
of Assistants, with the prudent and upright management of the Gent'men
of the Jury, Together with the testimonyes I have redy to give in, I
hope will thereby Evidently Appeare thatt I am not guiltie of Pyracy
or any Acttyons tending thereto, as is Layed to me in my Charge, And I
being over powered by the Privateers thatt did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span> tyranize over me, I
was forced contrary to my minde and will to doe whatt I did during the
time I was with the Privateers upon A voyage to the Eastward; for the
true determination of which and of my being Concerned therein I freely
and willingly Leave my Selfe to the wise, Judicious and Righteous
proceedings of this Honoured Courte and Gentlemen of the Jury, hopeing
the Lord will Cleare up my Innocency as to the matter of Factt, I
being Conscious to my owne Innocency. So desiring the Lord to direct
you In your Proceeding that Right may take place, not att all
doubtting butt thatt your Honors will soe dilligenttly search in to
the Cause thatt the Innosent may Bee Cleeared and the Guilty Suffer,
according to merritt, so wishin you all happienes, And for the
Continewance of which I shall ever Pray, etc., Subscribe my Selfe your
Faithfull Subjectt and Searvantt In all Hummillitye</p>

to return in three hours on pain of death; he met 60 Indians hauling
their canoes ashore: he killed 13 and took 8 alive, and pursued the
rest as far as he could go for swamps, and on his return burnt all the

an intercepted letter. Colbert was the great prime minister of Louis
XIV.; Seignelay, Colbert's eldest son, was minister of marine. The
document has a curious interest as showing perhaps the first instance
in which the (Brandenburg-) Prussian navy, or privateer marine,
touches American history. The Great Elector, Frederick William, had
for some time cherished ambitious designs, respecting the creation of
a navy and the establishment of colonies, but it was not till late in
1680 that he possessed a war-ship of his own, in 1681 that he began a
little establishment on the West African coast, in 1682 that he
founded his African Company. In this year 1679 he had a few ships
hired from a Dutchman, and it appears from this letter of the watchful
French minister that two others were being prepared for his service in
Zeeland. For five years he had been at war with France. His
allies&mdash;England, the Dutch, the Emperor&mdash;had made peace at Nymwegen in
1678. He was in danger of standing alone, and had made an armistice
March 31, prolonged May 3.</p></div>

in the meane time our Party Imbarkques in perriaugers and Cannoes,

lyeing here, wee gott greate acquaintance with the Natives of this

against the Spaniards, but could not know to have their revenge. they
understanding our designes, they corted us to land and thay would shew
us wheir was Spanish townes Plenty of Silver and golde; of which more

Samboles, sees a greate shipp rideing att an Anchor att the 2d Rainge
of Keyes, which coming neare they found her to be a French privateere,
One capt. Lessone, who carreen'd in the Samboles. The said capt.
understanding the designe wee weare about, Joyn'd his company with
ours, who weare about Eighty men out of him, so wee went with all our
parties on with corrage, and landed them about twenty leagues short of
Puerta Vella in an olde ruinated Port called Puerta Pee; the way was
very rocky and bad to march, they goeing near the sea side to Eschape
the look-out which thay saw plainely on a high Hill, butt as god would
have itt, the look-out did nott see them. this being Wensday they
begin to drawe neare Puerta Vella. The Satterday following, about ten
aclocke, came into an Indian Village. our peopple many of them were
weake, being three day with-out any foode, and their feete cutt with
the rocks for want of Shoose, soe an Indian man, crying out,
"ladroones",<a name="FNanchor_20_239" id="FNanchor_20_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_239" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> runs and make what speede he could to Puerta Vella.
so Coxon our Generall cryed out, "good boyes, You that are able to
runn gett into towne before wee are descryed". wee had then about 3
miles to Puerta Vella. The Indian being too nimble for us, wee being
tired afore, He gott into Puerta Vella about half a hower before us,
and cried out, "Ladroones!" Imediately wee heard the Alarm gunn fier.
wee then certainly knew that wee weare discried. wee made what hast
wee could into the towne, the forloorne<a name="FNanchor_21_240" id="FNanchor_21_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_240" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> being led by capt. Robert

before &mdash;&mdash; of the clocke in the Afternoon wee had taken the towne,
the peopple of the Place takeing to their stronge castle call'd the
Glory, to secure themselves. the next day the Spaniards, being about
two hundred, made an Attempt to come out of the Glory. wee face't them
and made them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span> to retreate back to their Castle to some of their
sorrowes, which fell to the ground. wee kept the towne 2 dayes,
plunder[ed] what wee could of itt, and putt the best of our Plunder
into cannoes which wee tooke their. some men marcht back by lands,
guarding the Prisonnars alonge with them, Hopeing wee should have had
ransome for them: wee carried our Plunder, Plate and prissonars downe
to a Key about 3 leauges and a half from Puerta Vella, The next Key's
to the Bastamentes,<a name="FNanchor_22_241" id="FNanchor_22_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_241" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and on Tuesday comes away Capt. Robert
Alleston to Springers carreeneing Key, to give notice to the Shipps
which was all their att anchor that wee should make what dispach wee
could to the Bastamentes, wheir our party lay. capt. Alliston
info[r]m'd us that thay had taken Puerta Vella and plundred the most
part of the Towne, without the loss of many men, onely five or six men
wounded, and that a cannoe of the best plunder, as cloth of silver,
cloth of tishee,<a name="FNanchor_23_242" id="FNanchor_23_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_242" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> being soe covittious to lode deepe, sanck in the
river comeing downe; the small fortes fiering, they wounded 2 or 3 men
in the cannoes. Our plunder being carried downe to the Bastamentes,
and our peopple which marched by land being come, carries plunder and
Prissnars uppon a Key lying aboutt half a mile from the maine land.
their came downe about 3 dayes after from Puerta Vella as neare as wee
could Judge seven Hundred soldiers, that came from Pennamau<a name="FNanchor_24_243" id="FNanchor_24_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_243" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and
arrived att Puerta Vella the tuesday as wee came away the Munday
before. the Spaniards came downe on brest the Key wee weire uppon, and
fired severall small armes, shooteing cleare over this Key, soe wee
tooke our prissnars with plunder and what wee had gotten att Puerta
Vella, and carried to another Key hard by, out of their Reaches, soe
our shipps come downe wheir the partie lay in dispute what to doe,
haveing some thoughts the Spaniard would send to relieve the
Prissnars. keepeing strickt watch, wee saw the next day a Barkque
longo<a name="FNanchor_25_244" id="FNanchor_25_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_244" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> standing in to Puerta Vella, which capt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span> bartholl'w Sharpe

Carthagene. Keepeing very good watch att top mast head, 3 day's after
wee saw comeing in a good bigg shipp, came from Carthagene. Our Shipps
and Sloopes weighs and went out and mett her, as she was standing in
to Puerta Vella. Capt. Allisson comeing up with her first in his
Sloope Ingages her, and Coxon seconding him clapps her aborde and
takes her without the loss of any men. some Spaniards fell for thay
fought about one hower. she had Eight gunn's, a new shipp of about
ninety tunn's, the chiefest of her ladeing being timber, salt and
corne, and about 30 Negroe's and about fower chest of silke, Besides
packetts of greate Conscernment from the King of Spaine, as was
Reported by them which by relacion of our armie, thatt our Generall,
capt. Coxon, had presented him in a Jarr of wine five Hundred peices
of gould which he wronged the party of by Keepeing of itt to himself,
he being sworne as well as any other man not to wronge any one. After
this wee sheard<a name="FNanchor_26_245" id="FNanchor_26_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_245" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> our Puerta Vella voyage, which was in money and

our shipps, that being the best place to carreene our shipps, by
reason their is good store of turtle and Manatee and fish, our shipps
being made cleane and ready for to sayle about six weekes time, butt
wee fell in with Boca Draga and went thro' Boca Draga into Boca Toro,
wheir seing a saile a cannoe went to her, and found itt to be a Barque

leaveing his olde one their, Capt. Essex leaveing his Barkque their
she being so rotten. wee acquainting capt. Peter Harriss and capt
Rich. Sawlking of the greate commerce wee had with the Indians in the
Samboles, was very willing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span> goe upp with their shipps, so all
concluded to goe upp to capt Lessones Carreeneing Key. Boca Toro lieth
about 50 leagues to leeward<a name="FNanchor_29_248" id="FNanchor_29_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_248" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of Porta Vella and Boca Drago 3

cal'd Toca Mora. all our English concluded to goe, but capt Lessoone
and capt Jno. Rowe their Peopple refus'd, being man'd all with French.
The Indians being very familliar came uppon a Key to our shipps, men,
Women and children, Informing us that whilst wee weare att Puerta
Vella the Spaniards had beene downe with about Eighty soldiers and had
fell uppon the Indians for their haveing familiarity with us. The
Spaniards did Kill of the Indians by their relation about 20, the rest
of the Indians takeing the mountans for their security tell wee came.
these Indians altho' Heathens yett have those amounge them that thay
call Doctors, that can raise the Divill att their Pleasure. they knew
of our comeing and att what time wee should be their, and when thay
saw us, it was greate sattisfaction to them, wee putting out a signe,
which was a white Jack and no Ensigne, then thay come on borde. thay
offers themselves to goe with us to take revenge of the Spaniards,
which they call by the name of walkers. Wee makeing in all, in mony,
Plate and Plunder, about a hundred peices of Eight a man att Puerta
Vella, peopple was Eagar for more Voyage, and was now fully resolved
to goe to the Goulden Island and hall our shipps into a small Cove or
creeke out of sight of any Spaniard, if any should come that way,
haling our small Barkques and small vessells as close as wee thought
convenient under the shelter of the greate shipps, and order so many
men to stay on borde of Each Vessell according to their bigness to
looke after them, and likewise order was given that if any should come
in their to oppose them, the peopple weare all of them to goe on borde
of capt. Coxon and capt. Peter Harriss's Shipp to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span> defend themselves

ensuing document, both by the same anonymous author, form one
continued narrative, of dramatic and astonishing piratical adventure.
For the second part, the adventures of these buccaneers in the Pacific
Ocean, there are other, parallel narratives, some of them longer than
ours; but with one exception they say almost nothing of this first
adventure, the capture and sack of Portobello. Two or three pages (pp.
63-65 of part III.) are indeed devoted to it in the chapter on "Capt.
Sharp's voyage", signed "W.D." [<i>not</i> William Dampier], which was
appended to the second edition of the English translation of
Exquemelin's <i>Bucaniers of America</i> (London, 1684), before Basil
Ringrose's detailed account of the South Sea adventures was printed
and issued (1685) as the second volume of that celebrated book; but
the present account is fuller than "W.D."'s, and may apparently be
regarded as the chief source now in print for the history of this
second English capture of Portobello. It should be remembered that, by
the signing of the various treaties of Nymwegen in 1678 and 1679, all
hostilities between European powers had by autumn of the latter year
been brought to an end. The privateers who had flourished during the
preceding years of warfare now found their occupation gone&mdash;their
lawful occupation at least. Many of them turned to piracy. The writer
of these two narratives speaks of his companions as privateers, but in
reality they had no legal status whatever. When the governor of Panama
asked for their commission, Captain Sawkins replied that "we would ...
bring our Commissions on the muzzles of our Guns, at which time he
should read them as plain as the flame of Gunpowder could make them."
Ringrose, p. 38. Legible, no doubt, but not legal.</p></div>

Halfe an Howers discource with the Indians. thay amounge Each other
chose out two men to goe before the forloorne, to shew us the way.
first of all wee marched through a small skert of a wood, downe to
sandy bay by the sea side, about 2 miles; the marching over the sandy
bay was tiersom, haveing our gunns Amunition and knapsacks of
provant<a name="FNanchor_3_252" id="FNanchor_3_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_252" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to carry with us, but after wee past this sandy Bay wee
Enters into a wood againe, which lead us into a valley which in time
of raines is full of water. by three of the clocke this day wee Had
martched from the shipps 3 leauges, and takes upp our seate, wheir wee

have borne us company to have martched next day, butt that he had a
childe sicke and fear'd would soone die; and when dead, would follow
us with a comepany of Indians with him; and soe tooke his leave of us.
The next day being tuesday, in the morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span> about 4 of the clock word
was gave to Martch, and that no man, on the loss of life, should fier
a gunn in the woodes, least some Indian Rogues or other should betray
us, by runing afore to acquaint the Spaniards. yesterday two men
tier'd, so went back againe. this tuesday wee Martched upp a very high
Hill. twas neare 10 of the clock before wee gott the topp of itt. one
man more tier'd, that return'd back againe. on this Hill wee could
finde no water, so that the company weare almost famisht for the want
theirof. the Indian pilotts gave us to understand that a little
farther was water, which about 2 of the clock wee came up with; wheire
wee all dranck and Refreshed our selves bravely. about 2 howers martch
farther wee gott downe to the foote of this Hill. on the South side is
a brave River whear wee tooke up our quarters that night, it being the
second night of rest since wee left our Shipps. this day wee martched
neare 14 miles E.S.E. nearest. the next day, being wensday the 7.
ditto, as soone as the Day brake wee weare uppon our Martch. about 10.
of the clocke wee rested and refresht our selves with bread an water,
and Pipes and tobacco; and about 3 of the clock wee tooke upp our
quarters againe, by a river side. in the woodes wee saw some Indian
Hutte, butt no strainge Indians, for wee went a course more to the
southward to fetch a Circute cleare of the Duryan Indians, who have a
continuall Peace with the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Thirsday the 8 wee wear desired by Our Indian Pilotes to be martching
by breake of day, that so wee might comepass 6 leauges, which wee did.
about 2 aclock wee came up with some hutts, wheir their Kinge lived,
who received us with greate kindness, being Joyfull of our company, as
he Exprest it by presenting us with Plantans, Cassado,<a name="FNanchor_7_256" id="FNanchor_7_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_256" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Indian
Corne, Drinck, and Rootes; haveing beene with us some time, return'd
to his house againe. his garment was of white cotton made like to a
friars cote. in the Evening the King came to us againe with his 2
sones, being in one garbe, save that the Kinge had in his Hand a longe
white rodd of about 7 foote longe, and a Hoope of Golde about his Head
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span> his crowne. this Hoope was about 2 Inches and a half broade. the
Kinge had 3 daughters of womens Estate, very comely Indians, who went
in fine cotton Roped about their bodies. Both men and women tooke much
delight to heare our Drum beate and colers fly but to fier a gunn or
to heare the noyse thay weare afraide. the Kings Daughters fantsied
much to be in our Company, in so much that some of our Peopple by
signes would ask them if they should live with them and thay be their
wives. thay often would make Arrants to their fathers house to fetch
us Plantans. The Kinge tolde capt. Coxon that the next day wee must
nott march butt that he must send one of his sones to gett cannoes, to
carry us all by water downe the river, and that in two dayes march
more (itt being Sunday) wee should come wheir these Cannoes wheir. wee
often mett with Indian Hutts in the Martch, in which the Peopple
stoode ready to throw us Plantans and give us corne drincke.<a name="FNanchor_8_257" id="FNanchor_8_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_257" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> wee
found that they weare makeing cannoes for us as fast as they could.
thiss day wee martcht about 5 leagues and came up with 3 or 4 Houses
close by a River-side wheir wee lodged. hear thay provided about 14
cannoes which those that weare most tired with martching went into,
about 90 men in the cannoes, 2 or 3 Indians to worke them downe the
River, thay haveing Experience to worke cannoes in a river wheir the
currant runns like an Arrow out of a bow.<a name="FNanchor_9_258" id="FNanchor_9_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_258" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the cheifest of our
company this Sunday marched againe. the cannoes went downe the River.
wee martched till night, where wee had all the rest of the cannoes
made ready, about 60; in some cannoes their wear 6, some 4 and 3
Indians according to the biggness. the Indians tolde us that with-in 2
dayes after, which was tuesday, wee should see the other cannoes which
went away out of the other river;<a name="FNanchor_10_259" id="FNanchor_10_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_259" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> wee weare putt all to a stand
att thiss and thoughts rise amounge us that these Indians onely
seperated us to bring us all to destruction, so thatt wee had much
grumbings amounge us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span> that thay made Signes wee should nott be
troubled att any thing. the next day, wee haveing cannoes and
Barkloggs enow, wee Imbarkques, haveing 2 Indians in Each cannoe, to
steare them downe, because the freshes runn soe swift as possible can
be Imagind, that the least touch of a cannoe against a stump or Rock
over setts them if nott staves them all to peices. Munday night past,
wee heare no newes of our other party that went away out of the other
river, butt the Indians tolde us by signes that, by such time the sunn
was att such a High as thay pointed, wee should see the other party.
Tuesday Every one takes to his cannoe againe and went downe the river,
and about 10 of the clock we saw an Indian cannoe a setting to us
against the streame, alonght the river side, who tolde us that our
cannoes which came downe the other River was gott to the place wheire
both rivers mett, wheir the Indians intended to meete us. about 2 of
the clock in the After noone we wear gott downe, and wear very glad to
Injoy the comepany of our owne Peopple againe. in comeing downe the
River some cannoes wear over sett; some lost their Armes, butt the
Indians would dive and gett them up againe. one man being left behinde
in the woodes astray, Expecting to Kill something to eate, the Indians
weare soe Kind as to bring him downe to us. thiss afternoone wee fixes
our Armes and cattoch<a name="FNanchor_11_260" id="FNanchor_11_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_260" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Boxes, Dryes our Poweder. now 20 leagues
farther wee come to a Place called Santa Maria,<a name="FNanchor_12_261" id="FNanchor_12_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_261" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to which place wee
rowe and paddle very hard alday. this place made all with Stockados,
no greate gunns, but onely a place to keepe the Indians out of the
river, itt being a river wheir thay take much golde. about one aclock
att night wee wear gotten close under the Stockadose, soe that wee
could heare the Centry talke. wee landed about half a mile from the
place in the woods and lay their till day. Next morning wee heard a
drum beate. thay fier'd a small arme to discharge their watch, which
hearing no more gunns fired wee knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span> that wee wear not descryed. Capt
Rich'd Sawlkings runns up to the Pallassados and all the party
following him as fast as thay could, and fiering att the Pallassados,
and thay att us; fiering with their harkquebusses, throweing lances,
and shooteing Arrowes. thay had within their Pallassados about 200
men. wee killed about 70 men. after wee had had about half an howers
dispute with them, Capt. Rich Sawlkings runns to the pallassado's with
2 or 3 men more, and halls up 2 or 3 pallassados by maine strength,
and enters in. thay Imediately calls for Quarter, which was presently
granted by us. this was one Thirday the 15 day of Aprill. the Governor
with 2 Negroes and 2 women made his Eschape by runing about a mile
downe the river, wheir he takes a cannoe and makes for Pennamau downe
the river so fast as he could, butt understanding he had made his
Eschape fitted in the Afternoone a cannoe with six oares. capt.
Sawlkings goes in her to see if he could finde this governor butt
could nott. wee lay att these Stockadose 2 dayes. itt is a very small
place onely to shelter those that goes to wash golde in another Arme
of the River, which comes out of a river<a name="FNanchor_13_262" id="FNanchor_13_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_262" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> into this Santa Maria
river. The Injury wee received in takeing the Pallassadoes was that
capt. Sawlkings was shott in the Head with an arrow, and one man more
shott in the hand, butt both soone cured. wee by Examining Our
Prissonars understoode, that 4 dayes before wee came there went away
for Pannamau 2 Small Barques which caried away 4 chests of dust golde.
thay had no newes of us before thay saw us. heare we found butt little
Riches. some church plate, as is reported, was found, some dust golde
in callabasses,<a name="FNanchor_14_263" id="FNanchor_14_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_263" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> some wines and brandy, Jerck porke, good store of
bread. the next day wee drawes out to see who would goe for the South
Seas, that is to say to take Pennamau; att last wee findes all our
party, butt ii which wear unwilling. Our Generall, capt. Coxon, seemed
unwilling, butt with much perswaission went; those ii men that would
returne, wee putts into their hands to carry that plate wee tooke
heare. thay had Indians to con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>duct them back. Now wee putts our
selves all in Readiness for Pennamau, which lieth about 30 leagues
from thiss Santa Marea river to the Northwards. wee wear 2 dayes a
roweing out of this snta Marea River, before wee gott into the South
Seas. in this place there runns very Stronge tydes of Ebb and floode.
the tydes keepe their common course as thay doe in the North Sea. itt
flowes by the moone S.S.E. soe wee getting out of the river and the
tyde of floode comeing on, wee rowed hard to gett over to a key which
wee saw,<a name="FNanchor_15_264" id="FNanchor_15_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_264" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and Stopt their till the floode had done. on which key
wee found the 2 Negro women which had made their Eschape alonge with
the Governor of the Stockadose. thay tolde us that the gover'r went
from thence that morning intending to row alonge shore with the 2
Negro men to Pennamau, he perswaiding him-self that wee would be for
Pennamau. wee sent one of our best cannoes to rowe after him, butt to
no purpose. Butt when wee left the Stockadose, the prissnars beggs of
us to carry them away with us, crying that the Indians would distroy
them all, soe when wee departed that Place wee carried with us what
wee possibly could. no soonar wee came a shore butt wee hears a
miserable crye. the Indians killed all the poore soules that weare
left. Now wee being in the South Sea's goes alonge shoare to a Plantan
Key,<a name="FNanchor_16_265" id="FNanchor_16_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_265" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which lieth about 14 leagues from Pennamau. wee tooke 2
Negroes which was sent thether to cutt woode for building as well as
to breede provissions. Barkques come from Pennamau to fetch itt. this
night as wee lay here wee saw a Barque on the back side of this key.
wee man'd 2 cannoes and went out and tooke her. she fier'd 2 or 3
small Arme's att us butt did not any harme. next morning we went all
out from the key in our cannoes. Our Gen'll capt. Coxon bad all
peopple that wear in small cannoes, to goe on borde the barkque and
putt their cannoes adrift. capt. Batt Sharpe went into the Barkque
commander, and about 135 men, which had beene in very small cannoes
and fearfull thay might Sinck under them. wee understood by this
barkque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span> that wee wear nott as yett descried att Pennamau. this day
wee makes sayle, Keepeing the Perriaugers and cannoes company. that

that same time when Sr. Henry Morgan tooke Pennamau. this capt.
Berralto was much burnt, and his peopple most of them kill'd and
blowne upp, for as thay fought us thay had scatter'd loose powder on
their decks, which tooke a fier by some accident or other, that wee
seeing itt borded them and tooke them. these 7 sayle of shipps we
tooke att Pennamau was not above half unloded. their lading was
flower, linnen and woolen cloath, one greate shipp half laden with
Iron. wee desierd of capt. Berralto which wear the best saylors. he
told us on his word the <i>Trinnity</i> was the best in the South Seas, soe

Just as wee wear goeing to land in a bay about 2 leagues to the
Southwards of the towne, wee saw many horse men rideing alonge Shoare,
so that wee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> findeing no convenient Place to land, rowed a little of
Shoar and consulted togather. wee lay in sight of the shipps, and saw

some of the Spaniards, which made them to retreat to a greate hill,
about 5 mile from the towne. wee Entred the towne and kept possession
of 4 dayes. wee askt the flagg of truce five hundred thousand peeces
of Eight for the randsome of thiss towne, and told him that the next
day by 10 of the clock, thay should bringe their money, otherwise wee
would burne the towne. the next day the flagg of Truce came downe by
12 of the clock, and tolde us thay would give no randsome. wee
understood thiss flagg of truce Had a suit of law in hand, and was
likely to be cast, as he afterwards told us, which would be the ruing
of him-self. he shew'd us his house and desier'd us to sett fier on
itt, whatever wee did. fa[r]ther told us that if we weare not gone the

sowed tyte, some fellow of a Spaniard had Venterd off and laid itt on
the rudther and Stearn Post (itt stufft with powder), satt itt on

lookeing every wheir. One man, seeing a light come into the Cabban,
lookes out att the Stern-Portes, and spies wheir itt was, cryes out
for more help, and by a providenc of God gott itt speedily out. some
Imagined itt to be a Plott of the Prissnars aborde against us. some

because he found them out first, and Putt a parcell of goates on them,
and since have bredd to a mighty number. aboundance of Fish and
Seales; as fine keys as any in these seas to recruite att, being water

neither any cattle, so that wee did nott stop their att all, but went
to the Estermost key, wheir wee come to anchor, with a northerly
winde. att the South sid of thiss Island is a brave Sandy bay but no
rideing if the wind come out Southerly; then you may runn downe to the
leeward side of the Island. Our master, Jno. Hilliard, for some
misdemeanor was turn'd out of his Place, and his mate, one Jno. Hall,
putt in Master. Hall went with a cannoe mand to Leeward to find a bay
which he thought might have beene a good place, seeing no better, so
wee ridd 2 dayes with the Shipp at the Southermost bay. the wind
coming out againe att S.E. and b.S. and S.S.E., we waied and putt to
sea, fearing twould blow hard, itt being an open bay. so wee rann
downe to thiss other bay our new master had found out, and lett goe
anchor. our cable parted. wee weire faine to goe father to looke for
another anchor Place, and about 4 miles to the N.W. we saw a fine
large bay and rivers of water, that wee filled our water close to the
water sid, wooding convenient, fish great store, Seals Inumerable,

nott above 7 miles round, butt very high and Hilly, full of Valleys,
so that wee rowed on the westward sid of the Island to windward or to
the southward to hunt for goates. In thiss second bay of anchorag,
came downe such flawes of wind out of the Valleys that our Anchor
could nott hold, that wee almost drove aShore. our Peopple cutting
wood and filling water, which was the greater Party, haveing no love
for capt. Batt. Sharpe, concludeing togather to turne him out of his
capt'shipp, which thay did, and Putts into his Place a stout rugged
fore man as captaine;<a name="FNanchor_58_307" id="FNanchor_58_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_307" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> itt was much trouble to capt. Sharpe to be
thuss served, butt could nott help himself, for the peopple weir
Resolved nott to goe home by Sea before thay had more money. wee lay
in thiss small bay, which was about 2 miles to leeward of thiss greate
bay, about 3 dayes. wee made hast and gott our Anchor we lost and
water aborde, and the most part of the wood wee had cutt. wee wear
minded to have spent a moneths time att thiss key of Juan Fernandus
and then to have gon downe to have cruised till the next Year; Our
Blacksmith was ashore prepareing to have built a forge, and made Iron
worke for the Shipp, and Intended to have burnt charcole. he had
partly fixed his bellose. wee had two men of warr cannoes gon to
windward for goates and had found, by relacion, 150 fatt ones, butt
sleepeing alnight by a fier att the Sea Side and in the morning went
to fetch their goates, lookeing out to se if the Sea weir cleare of
shipps Spyed within 3 leagues of the Island 3 greate saile of Shipps,
Admirall, Vise Adm'll and Rear Adm'll; seeing thiss, made what hast
they could to their cannoes and soe on borde shipp, leaveing all their
goates behind them bound. as soone as thay came near the Shipp thay
warned us with 3 Motions, that wee understoode their was 3 saile. wee
gott all our peopple that weir on shore off and what other things wee
could, gott our anchor on bord, had nott time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> gett the Other butt
lett him slipp, hoysted in Our launch and canno's. by thiss time thay
weir came within sight of us; so near that wee could se a weapon
florrished on the quarter deck of the Adm'll. wee understoode wee had
left one of our Strikears on shore that had gott under a tree to
Sleepe, sent a cannoe for him but could not finde him, soe came of to
the Shipp and left him their.<a name="FNanchor_59_308" id="FNanchor_59_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_308" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> these 3 shipps Clings the wind and
stands After us. the reare Adm'll which was the least had 12 gunns,
their Vise Adm'll 16 and their Adm'll 24. Our new capt., being Jno.
Watkins, would have gon aborde the Adm'll if the Party had beene
willing; wee could wronge them by sayling att our Pleasures, bye or
large, soe that wee played with them a day and a night. then wee
concluded twas our time to goe downe and take Arrica, the Place that
wee made an attempt att before. wee made what sayle wee could,
Steering N.E. and b.N., to fall in about 30 leagues to windward of
Arrica, which wee did very well, but we weir tolde of a fishing key
that lay hear abouts 18 leagues from Arrica;<a name="FNanchor_60_309" id="FNanchor_60_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_309" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> wee concluded to go
thither, which was our greate folly, and so standing off and on, those
on the key saw us and forthwith sent to Arica to informe them of us.
Our man of warr cannoes, roweing alonge shore to thiss Key, was 2
dayes before came up with itt, which att last did, and took 2 Antient
men Prissnors, about 75 years of Age. here we gott some fish and wine.
our peopple Examin'd the 2 old men, found them in two tailes, the one
being trew, the other not, as wee found Afterwards. the one tolde us
that Arica had news of us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span> and that he believ'd thay would be provided
for us; for he sd. a Post would ride from the sand key to Arica in 3
dayes. for thiss Speech the man was shott downe by our quarter master
Jno. Duill. the Other was made much of, because was supposed to speake
the truth. soe wee made what hast wee could to Arica, and on a sunday
Morning, itt being in March, wee landed 82 men, wee understanding itt
to be a small towne. our orders was, if wee saw 3 Smokes rise from the
hill thay called the More, wee should make what hast wee could into
the harbor. Our Peopple marching till thay came to the towne, saw no
peopple till they Entred the townes End, wheir thay found Every topp
of a house fitted for them, and a fort of 12 gunns mounted. their
houses hear are built all flatt att the topp, for they never have any
Raines, no, nott in the remembrance of the Spaniards, butt very greate
dewes. Wee fell on the towne smartly, and became Victors in fouer
howers time so that twas our owne, Notwithstanding their was above 700
men In Armes, att our comeing.<a name="FNanchor_61_310" id="FNanchor_61_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_310" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> all the Cuntry within 20 myles was
come inn and more in greate Number comeing. wee tooke the biggest
church to Make a Hospitall for our wounded men, which weare about
tenn, and six killd out right. Our capt. Jno. Wattkings was kill'd att
the same time, to our discomforts. One of the capt. of the Spaniards
which wee had taken, Spake in his owne linqua<a name="FNanchor_62_311" id="FNanchor_62_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_311" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> to thiss Efect,
"Gent men, I know you are men come to seeke a fortune, if You want
money or Plate goe alonge with me, I will shew you wheir their is more
then you all can carry away." wee gave no credit to him, butt was
minded to fall on uppon the forte to take their greate gunns for the
shipp, haveing none on board. Our Party being so tired, and cutt off,
wee weare feigne to leave the greate gunns, money, all the Rest of the
rich traide which was in that small towne. three of our Doctors being
in the Hospitall Church dressing of our wounded men, had about 6 men
Order'd to guard them with their Armes. after wee saw we weir so
worsted and beaten,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span> fighting against so greate Advantage, Some
peopple rann to bid them come away as could march, for our Party was
gon out of the towne. the Spaniards seeing thiss gott fresh to their
Armes againe, and rallied upp with us about the church that they durst
no come out, so that their was left 5 well men besides the 3 Doctors
which had not one Dropp of blood spilt from them. one or two of the
wounded men that had good hearts gott up and rann to the Party, and
tho' thay had many a shott made by the Spaniards att them, yett Scapte
clear. so many of our Party being almost choked for water, made use of
their owne; butt comeing downe to the water side wheir the launch and
cannnoe lay reddy to receive them, their follows them a parcell of
Negro's and Mallattos, which stood on a High Hill Just over the
Cannoes and throwes Downe Stones and Launces on Our Peopple. In thiss
frey, wee had taken, kill'd and wounded about 30. Wee Judge wee could
not Distroy of them less then 150 or 200 men, for they lay very thick
in the Streetes. Their governor or Gen'll was upon a Hill calld the
More, on Horse back, Just over the towne, from whence he could see
into every Streate and which way wee went. he often weaved to his
soldiers from thence, With his Handkerchiffe, to gave them notice
which way wee went, and crying out, "Valiente soldados, buina Valienta
Soldados."<a name="FNanchor_63_312" id="FNanchor_63_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_312" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Some of our peopple passed a shott att him but could
not have the fortune to hitt him. Our former new capt., Jno.
Wattkings, being kill'd att this Place, capt. Sharpe would have thrust
himself capt. againe. Soe that our party resolved to goe downe to
leeward. The most voyces wear to have the shipp, the lessar to have
the Launch and two cannoes. One party was resolved to stay, the other
to goe over Land, as will be presently related. wee now wanting water
and soe like to be in greate Distress, considered, and with the advise
of our Spanish pilott wee must goe into Ylo<a name="FNanchor_64_313" id="FNanchor_64_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_313" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> for water, butt wee
learneing by some Spanish Journalls that their was water 14 Leagues to
windward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> of Ylio, which place wee Indeavord to comepass, and comeing
thither, found such a sea goeing as could nott gett ashoar with our
Cannoe; Soe Endeavor'd to gaine the Keys of Juan Fernandas againe. But
the windes bloweing so much southerly we could nott. soe leaveing itt
into the Shoare with our Starboard tacks on board, fetcht the bay
the[y] call't Vispo, in which their is a brave River and very good
water, which bay lieth in South lattd. 29&deg;.<a name="FNanchor_65_314" id="FNanchor_65_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_314" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> So wee fill their
about six tunn of water, And by Informacion of a Prissnor their taken,
that att Coequembo lay 2 men of warr, and he beleived would be downe
next morneing, thiss bay of Vispo being butt 15 leagues N. and b.W.
from Coquembo. att thiss Place wee found a new barkque and building.
some sheepe and goates wee brought of for foode, butt the Barkque wee
left, hopeing to have better of her hereafter. Putting out of this
Porte wee saild alonge N.N.W. 3 dayes, about 8 leagues of Shoare, to
another bay lying about 24 degrees South lattd, A Bay cal'd by the
name of Capt. Drakes his bay, Because that when he was their he
water'd. their is a brave fresh water River, And to thiss day is
standing a church which the sd. cap. Drakes causd to be Built for his
Memoriall; alltho' wee could nott gett on shoare by the Violence of
the Suff, yett the church was very vissible to us, nott being above
one quarter of a mile from itt.<a name="FNanchor_66_315" id="FNanchor_66_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_315" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> so that att last wee wear forc't
to goe to Ylo to fill our Bumkings<a name="FNanchor_67_316" id="FNanchor_67_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_316" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> with water. wee stay'd hear two
Dayes but dare make no longer stay, for fear the cuntry should come
downe uppon us. This Ylo lieth N.W. and b.W. from the Afore named
Arica, above 26 leges, And in the lattd. of 17&deg; 45&acute; South lattitude.
Ylo beareth from the Citty lymmo S.B.E. 120 legs. now haveing fill'd
thiss water we putts to sayle to carry the party which was minded to
Martch back into the North Seas. wee rann down alonge, N.W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span> and by N.
and N.W., Just keepeing sight of land because would not be Descried,
which way wee went. About 9 dayes wee saild N.W. and b.N. and N.W.,
and meeting with a Strong Currant which as wee Judged Satt N.E. into a
bay, wee fell in with a small Island about five Miles round, in the
lattd. of 7&deg; 40&acute; So. and about 12 leagues off the Maine shoare. to
thiss Island our Prissnars tolde us severall Barkques came to for
pretious Stones, which weir to be found their. Due East from thiss key
lieth Another which is Inhabbited, 7 leagues from thiss key and 5
leagues from the maine or Trucksilly,<a name="FNanchor_68_317" id="FNanchor_68_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_317" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which is a towne wheir is
water, and on thiss key cattle; aboundance of Fish is made here. Wee
Just weatherd the small Rockey key on which the Pretious Stones are
founde; wee had the wind att S. and B.E. and S.S.E., a fine topp saile
gaile and fair weather. wee Steares away N. and b.E. to make Point
Sta. Alena, the Point that is before discourst of, that makes the
Northermost Point of the River Yakeell. the next day was upp with the
Isle of Plate, which lieth in South lattd. about 50&acute;. then the Party
thatt resolved to goe over land, began to provide for Vittuall. their
was about 56 of them, which carried away what thay had. thay had a
launch and two cannoes. itt was on Sunday, after wee had din'd with
what wee had, which was att that time onely bread and water. and now
being under the Equinoctiall about a ii leagues from Shore wee [saw]
Mount a Christo plaine,<a name="FNanchor_69_318" id="FNanchor_69_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_318" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> that lieth some leagues in the cuntry, The
Mount bore of us E.S.E. these poore men when parted from us had about
5 leagues to goe, before could Conveniently Land, for wild Indians and
negro's, which by shipping formerly their was cast away, and since
grone very Populus and Barberous, As we wear inform'd by our
Prissnors. thay did intend to take thiss island of &mdash;&mdash; or Cork
Island, which lieth in the bay of the Gorgony. now thay being gon both
parties wear much troubled att the parting, Yett the party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span> that went
away would have staied in case Sharpe had nott beene made capt., for
thay could not by any meanes allow of him to be capt. more of us would
have gon away, Butt capt. Sharpe sends his Master to us who spoke
thuss (his Name was Jno. Cooxe), "Gentmen, capt. Sharpe doth declair
and swair that those men that will stay with him and goe about in the
shipp with him by water, that he will make them a Voyage, and doe the
uttmost of his power to gett money Enough, and will not have thoughts
of goeing out of these till every man is willing." soe wee consider'd
our shipp was foule. wee that stayed wear about 61 soles in number.
with the advise of capt. Batt. Sharpe was resolved to run downe to
Pennamau, and to leeward, to finde some private place to cleane our
shipp in, and to take her one deck lower. wee searching of some
Spanish Jurnalls findds mention of an Island lieing to the No'ward in
8 degrees called the Island of canes, wheir wee found thiss Isle of
Canes;<a name="FNanchor_70_319" id="FNanchor_70_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_319" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and by our observacion lieth in North lattitude, 7&deg; 30&acute;.
their is good wooding and watering butt no secure place for a shipp to
ride in, without very good Anchors and Cables, which wee att that time
was Ill provided with. wee staied here 3 dayes and killed one sow and
Pigg and fill'd water. here are good large Oysters. so wee sett saile
with full intencion to goe into the Gulph of Dulce,<a name="FNanchor_71_320" id="FNanchor_71_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_320" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> if wee could
find itt, but wee stearing away N.W. about 33 English legs from thiss
Isle of Canes, which Island lieth 5 legs from the Maine shore, and
comeing in with the land saw a brave deepe gulph, which concluded was
a good Place for us to cleane Our shipp, hopeing that their might be
no Inhabitance. Into which gulph we rann, by sounding of our leade so
farr as wee could, Except wee had had a Pilott for that place. wee
hoyst our 2 men of warr cannoes And went upp the Gulph. capt. Batt.
Sharpe Imbarkque[d] in one of them him self, to see if could take an
Indian to understand whatt for a place itt was; goeing about 4 leagues
ahead of the shipp, comes upp with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span> Island lying in the gulph of
Nicoy,<a name="FNanchor_72_321" id="FNanchor_72_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_321" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which Island wee understood by some Indians was called the
Island of Perroz or in English the Isle of doggs. wee found 3 or 4
families which lived heare of Indians, very poore, haveing all thay
gett once in two years taken from them by the fryars, and thay tell us
that if thay have nott to pay the friars what their demands is when
thay come, that thay carry away their children and makes them Slaves.
Butt our capt. Batt. Sharpe Asked of one Indian that could speak
Spanish, if any Shipp used to come their. he said that their was att
pressent 2 small Barkques that weir come from Pennamau, which weir
lodeing with hides and tallow bound for Pennamau again. The Indian
tolde the capt. he would Shew us wheir they weir; with whome capt.
Sharpe went with his cannoe well man'd, thiss Indian leaveing some
hands on the Isle of Perros or Dogges, to see that none gott away to
discry us, with our Shipp getts on brest the Island and Comes to an
Anchor, and missing the right channel lay their not haveing above 3
foote water more then wee drew. thiss was about 25 of Aprile 1681. the
next morning these two barkes was taken, the one being 2 thirds loden
and the other half loden with talloe; wee tooke out as much as wee
thought might serve to tallow our Shipps bottom twice and to make us
candles, and no more, which is as I Imagin about 60 or 70 Packs. Now
wee wanting carpenters understoode by thiss Indian Pylott that their
was 2 shipps up an Arme of a River, about 4 leagues from thiss Isle of
Dogges. The Indian conveighs us the next night upp to them. the
morning about an hower before day wee comes wheir thay weir building,
about 300 tunns a Peice; one of them haveing beene on the Stocks about
3 years. itt Pleas'd god wee tooke the head carpenter and the Rest of
his gange, which weir about 12 in Number, with their tooles, about 6
Jarrs of wine and Brandy, which was much to our comfort, haveing lived
for some time before on bread and water. takeing these carpenter[s]
with their tooles, wee weare in greate hopes to have Our Shipps upper
deck taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span> downe and made better for sayleing in little time, with
the help of our owne carpenters; butt to carreene her here is
impossible Because of a greate citty about 18 leagues from thiss
lagoone of Nicoy, itt being the citty Naine,<a name="FNanchor_73_322" id="FNanchor_73_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_322" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> wheir thay can Raise
20000 Men. wee fell lower downe in the River, as lay out of the way of
the tide as much as could, for here the tides runn very Stronge and
keepes itts course of moone. itt flows S.S.W., which when the moone
comes to thiss S.S.W. point itt makes high water. itt flowes about 3
fathom and half right upp and downe. when wee brought these Spanish
carpenters on borde, our capt. and carpenter Shewed the Spannish
carpenter what thay would have done, desiering him to be reall, and
tell them in what time itt might be finished. he promis'd that within
10 day, with the assistance of our peopple, he did nott doubt butt
finnish itt; att which our capt. and company told him that as soone as
he had done he should have one of the barques for his paines, and all
he[r] ladeing of tallow, and that he would sett them all ashore
againe. thiss Spannish carpenter being a very Ingenious worke man, and
saw wee shew him and his company a greate deale of respect, which
begott a love in him to us, for he tolde us wee should make what
dispatch wee could out of the lagoone, for the cuntry was very
populus, and would soone be after us if could procure any Imbarcation.
the carpenter dispatcht is [his] buisness in 12 days, so that he and
his comepany had the Barkque and all her loding. putting them ashore
with some Prissnors wee had taken before, wee take a perriauger that
come downe to thiss Isle of dogges, with a Spannish March't and a
Mustees woman, which we suppose he kept. the woman lieing on borde one
or two nights, was very familiar with one Copas a dutch a man,<a name="FNanchor_74_323" id="FNanchor_74_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_323" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> who
formerly had saild with the Spaniards, and had the linqua att will,
but was mainly Inamoured with thiss women, makeing her severall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
presents of some Vallew. after the carpenters weir gone wee fell downe
lower in the lagoone to fill water. thiss Copas goeing aShore to guard
the Prissnars that fill'd water made an Excuse to goe into the woods
to kill some thing to eate, but went cleare away, that wee never saw
him since, carrying with him about 200 Peices of Eight in golde and
Silver, that putt us in feare least he would give Intelligence which
way wee weir bounden, wee being att this time butt a small partie,
about 64 soules, and nott any greate gunn to help us. in takeing of
these carpenters one of our men, a Scotch man, haveing dranck to much,
by some way or Other gott out of the cannoe and was drounded. the
peopple telling us the Barkque saild primely well and the best saylor
belonged to Pennamau wee kept her to waite on the Shipp. shee was a
small open barkque. wee tooke in her a man that was acquainted with
thiss Gulph of Dolce, who tolde us wee might lay the shipp on shore
their very well and no body see us, nor any Spaniard know we weir
their, so wee concluded to go. about May the first 81, wee arrived in
this Gulph of Dulce. itt lieth from the lagoone of Nicoy about 47
leagues South and from the Island of canes ii leagues S.S.E. wee found
according to what the Spanish fellow tolde us, a very fine place to
hall our Shipp on shore to cleane her. Here we caught some fish and
turtle and fedd well for the time wee lay here. we Built a house
ashore to putt our provissions in, to keepe them from the Raines, and
carried ashore the most part of our Ballast, in the barkque and men of
war cannoes. wee findeing the small barque to Saile very well, the
Capt. putt in 7 Hands to her, to sayle her. as wee lay one night ready
to hall a shore the next high water, the winde blew att South very
hard, that our after mast cable gave way, that the shipp drave ashore
against the rocks, we weir afraid should have bildged her; but the 2
carpenters, being carefull, shord her up to ease her what thay could,
and the next flood heav'd her off againe to a sandy place in the bay,
wheir wee found some butt heads started and abundance of nailes and
spikes wanting, which our carpenters had provided for and drave
aboundance in her bottom. we lay here about 5 weekes, mending our
sailes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span> and fixing our rigging. here cam in to us some Indian men,
women and children, to whome wee gave Victualls and drink; thay staid
with us tell we had done our shipp; some times giveing us plantans,
and some time goeing into the woods, finding bees nests, would give us
the Honney; butt the most good these Indians did us, wee had their
barque loggs<a name="FNanchor_75_324" id="FNanchor_75_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_324" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> all the time we lay hear to make us a Staige. Some of
them goeing away Amounge the Spaniards tolde them that their was a
greate Shipp in the Gulph, and that wee weir a casting of greate
gunns. Butt these Indians that came to us tolde us that the Spaniards
had tolde them if any shipps came in that had any thing of redd in
their collers,<a name="FNanchor_76_325" id="FNanchor_76_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_325" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that thay should have a caire and not come on borde
of them nor lett us see them, telling them that wee would kill them;
but as itt happen'd we went in with all white collers, which was the
Spanish order that thay should Assist all those, for thay weir their
friends and would doe them no harme. the Spaniard lives here from the
Gulph of Dulcey about 3 dayes Journey. thiss Gulph lieth in lattd. 7&deg;
22&acute; No. lattd. wee fitted our Shipp, clensed our bottom what wee
could; the small barque filld water, cutt wood, and went away to Sea
to looke for Purchase.<a name="FNanchor_77_326" id="FNanchor_77_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_326" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> we went from thiss place about the last of
June 81, haveing a good fresh gaile att S. and B.E. and S.S.E. wee
stands over thiss bay, cald the bay of the Gorgony, which Isle of
Gorgoney wee carreend att the last Year lieth in No. lattd. 3&deg; 35&acute;, or
their abouts. the land that we made was 7 leagues farther to windward.
here generally setts a greate currant out of the Sea into thiss bay
E.N.E. wee fell in first with Barraco Island and cock Island. wee now
bethinks our selves that twas time in the year to gett up to windward
to goe through the streights of Magelene. wee recruted here with
water, filling all we could. about 30 leagues W.S.W. from thiss Island
Barricoes we turnes up to windwards, and of[f] Cape passagoe, which
lieth in 45&acute; No. lattd.,<a name="FNanchor_78_327" id="FNanchor_78_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_327" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> wee cruises a good way of shore, about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
16 or 18 leagues, sees a saile, we gave chase, and comes up with her
about 9 aclock of night. we found her to come out of Yakell, bound for
Pennamau. the same shipp wee took loden with cloth and other goods the
Laste year, which was then bound upp to Lymmo. she had in her now good
Store of cloth, silk, stockings, mony and Plate, about forty thousand
peices of Eight, and severall good things, butt the chiefest of her
lading was coco. wee tooke out her what we thought convenient and
carried her under the shore and came to an Anchor, and when we had
done rummageing her putt them all aborde, cutt downe their maine mast,
gave them Victualls and Drinck enough, and putt them to sea to goe
right afore the wind for Pennamau. the master was very glad we gave
him his shipp againe, and the most part of his lodeing; that he swore
wee wear the Honnestest ladrones that ever he saw in his daies. we
went of to sea cruiseing for more. we understood by thiss last prise
that the Spaniards could not tell if [we] wear to windward or
leewards. 3 dayes after in the morning we spies a small barque close
by shore. wee gave chaces to her, came up hand over hand with her. She
makes what she could for the Shore, their being one Spaniard in her
that knew us, who we had taken the last year. She comes to an Anchor
with in a quarter of a mile of the Shore, and a fryar and 4 Negro's
getts ashore uppon a Planck and takes to the woods, but some staied on
borde the barque. capt. Batt. Sharpe in a man of war cannoe follows
them and come upp with some of them ashore. we found nothing butt a
little Plunder. their letters of advice thay had hove over borde, butt
they confest their was advice bound up to Yakell to give notice that
wee weir in the gulph of Dulcey acleaning our shipp and acasting of
greate gunns, as they heard. these Prisnars give us advice of a new
Vice Roys comeing out of olde Spaine to Puerta Vella, and was come
over land to Pennamau, and a greate Shipp lay their of 14 gunns to
take him in.<a name="FNanchor_79_328" id="FNanchor_79_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_328" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> thay told us thay had aboundance of riches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span> with him;
wee tolde them when wee had cutt their mane mast by the borde and sent
them to Pennamau, that we lay waiteing for him and bid them tell the
Vice Roy soe when they came to Pennamau. we cruises for more purchase
and about 12 leagues from the cape, in a drisly misty morning, a man
goeing to toppmast head saw a saile under our Lee, which wee made
saile to and come upp with her; we fired severall small Armes before
they called for quarter, butt calling, was presently granted and not a
gunn fier'd. her capt. was short downe in takeing of her. we found She
was a shipp bound for Pennamaw, came downe from Lymmo loden with wine
and brandies, but very little plate, 700 piggs of Peuter, which we
thought was silver, found to the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_80_329" id="FNanchor_80_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_329" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> we now Resolveing to
goe about this year if Pleasd God, we tooke out of her 700 Jarrs of
wine, about 100 Jarrs of brandy, to serve us homewards, and had itt
nott beene for thiss wine and brandy was Impossible to have subsisted.
we cutt thiss shipps maine mast by the bord and sent her afore the
wind to Pennama. wee kept about 18 Negroes and Indians to wash and
pump our shipp. thiss last priz gave us full information of the
Armado, which was to sayle from Lymmo, about 17 sayle of Shipps. the
15 day of September 81, wee turnd alonge shore as high as cape
Blanco,<a name="FNanchor_81_330" id="FNanchor_81_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_330" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and then haveing a trew traid winde att S.S.E. and S.E.
and b.S., sometimes South East, we all concluded to make the best of
our way out of these seas; we haveing gotten ii hundred Peices of
Eight a man in mony and Plate uppon Equall shairs, tho' itt was some
of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> fortune to loose our Voyage by Play afterwards; which those
that were the winners to have the more. wee had the winds most att
S.E. and b.S. and S.S.E. and S.E. wee stood of to sea, steming S.W.
and b.W. and S.W., commonly makeing a West 35&deg; southerly way, sayling
after the rate of 5 or 6 leagues a watch. fine moderate windes and
fair weather. we found a currant sett here to the S.W. quarter. we
stands up to Payta, which is about 13 leagues to the Southwards of
cape Blanco, and in so. lattd. 5&deg;. wee wear minded to take itt, butt
the fryar and fower Negro's, which made their Escape out of the little
Barque we tooke under the Shore, had gott before us, and sent to every
sea porte towne to give them notice that we wear a comeing to windward
as fast as we could, so on a Sunday Morning our capt. Sharpe, with
about 36 hands, went to land att Payta, butt found itt so well lyned
with men that thay durst not adventure On itt, but come back againe,
resolveing to live on bread and water till such time as could be
better supplied, concludeing that our wine and brandy would keepe us
alive. wee now makes no more tacks alonge shore, but stands close
hal'd on a boleing to sea,<a name="FNanchor_82_331" id="FNanchor_82_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_331" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> about 670 leagues due West from Payta,
till we come up to 33 So. lattd. ther we had variable winds. wee hal's
in for the shore, getting our Larbord tacks on borde, the wind comeing
out at N.W. in that quarter that wee could not fetch the Keys of Juan
Fernandus, wheir wee Expected to Recruit with fresh goates and water,
and to have faught<a name="FNanchor_83_332" id="FNanchor_83_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_332" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> off our Musketa-Indian we left their the time
before, but we getting to the Southwards of these keys, and the winds
comeing out for Northerly, was forced to ply to the Southward, and
then wee had Some raines, which from 7&deg; So. lattd. till you come to
28&deg; So. lattd., is never no raine by the Spaniards report nor since
thay have inhabited the cuntry, which hath been about 180 years; yett
very good Corne growes, and all sorts of Herbs and graine, but thay
[have] Extreeme dues. wee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span> stands still to the Southward, and haveing
now great variation, 13 or 14 degrees, we wear very Exact in takeing
Amplitudes,<a name="FNanchor_84_333" id="FNanchor_84_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_333" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> to be the more Sattisfied in thick weather of our true
course made. wee stood to the S.E. and S.E. and B.S. 700 leagues, and
about 3 aclock in the Morning the watch saw breakers very near us
under our Lea. it blew hard, that 2 nights before we had handed<a name="FNanchor_85_334" id="FNanchor_85_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_334" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
our topp sailes, and went under a pair of Coarses and our mizon. wee
wear gott now up to 50&deg; 8&acute; So. lattd. itt being a little light, before
day wee saw the land plaine. wee heaved out our topp sailes reeved and
made shift to weather all the breakers, and when twas day we discried
a place between 2 keys which we concludes to beare up to see if wee
could finde any good Anchoring and saife rideing till twas a little
later in the year. twas very colde heare, much raine, The Hills coverd
with Snow. wee went in along the key side about 4 leagues and saw a
very convenient cove. wee came to an Anchor the 3d of November,
thinking to stay hear till the weather was a little warmer. the first
night we lost one Anchor, the Cable being Very bad. we warped and
towed into another Cove, lieing a little more to the Southwards, the
wind blowing N.N.W. wee gott the ends of all our cable and Hassers and
made fast ashore to the trees; yett all would Hardly doe, for when it
blew hard, our cable would give way and our shipp in dainger of
driveing ashore, which if had we should lived like Heathens amounge
the Savage Indians, and never have come to rights, but we spliced and
Strengthend our cables what we could and with much difficulty made
them hold out. the 21 day of november 81 wee putt out of thiss place
to sea. wee lay here about 22 dayes, feadeing most on lempotts<a name="FNanchor_86_335" id="FNanchor_86_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_335" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and
Mussles, which wee gatherd of the rocks and makes very good foode. our
wine and brandie was a greate Help to us thiss cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span> weather. clothing
wee had good Store. some times we gott a Penguine, which are plenty in
these streights, which are as greate as a goose, but cant fly, haveing
on their winges onely stubbs of feathers. hear we saw a fier and made
to itt, wheir we saw an Antient Indian, and a younge fellow and a
woman Indian, which had about their bodies a Seale Skinn to keepe them
warme. thay saw us and rann away, but we over tooke the younge fellow,
which tooke to throwing of Stones. the olde man tooke the water and
was so cunning in diveing that our Peopple could not gett him, so they
shott him in the water. the woman gott away from us the next day. one
of our cannoes went downe to this place againe, and carried the Indian
that was taken alonge with him, which Indian carried our peopple to
thre or 4 wigwams, wheir was fier, but could see no peopple. the
fellow cald in their Speech but none appeard, he makeings signes that
thay weare greate tall men with longe beards.<a name="FNanchor_87_336" id="FNanchor_87_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_336" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> when our peopple saw
none came, thay returned to the cannoe, carying this Indian fellow
which was very unwilling to goe but Strugled to gett away, twas as
much as 3 or 4 of our men could do to binde him, and force him downe
to the cannoe, His strength was so greate. wee doe Imagin that here
may be some Spaniards which formerly have been cast away; for to the
Southwards about 4 legs when wee came out with our Shipp we saw to
very greate fiers but wear la'ft [<i>sic</i>] to see what thay weir, but
went to sea, stearing away S.W. and B.S. and S.W. the winds weir very
hard att N.W. we went under a pair of courses, haveing no observation
in 3 days after wee came out of these Lempot keys, wee stearing as far
to the westwards for fear of the Island called the 12 Appostle and 4

and wee so to the Southwards of the Streights could not gett to the
Northwards againe, but the capt. and Master, with advice of some
others, concluded to goe about terra fuega,<a name="FNanchor_89_338" id="FNanchor_89_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_338" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and so to goe through
the New Streights, the Streights of Maria, which wee had a Journall of
2 Brothers called by name Noddles, which was about 65 years agon sent
out to discover these parts of the world,<a name="FNanchor_90_339" id="FNanchor_90_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_339" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> which thay gave

downe to the Northwards, and entred the Streight of Magelena, and came
thro' into the North Sea, wheir he speakes of aboundance of those
birds called Penguins, whear thay laded, bold with them.<a name="FNanchor_91_340" id="FNanchor_91_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_340" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> wee had

59&deg; 30&acute; South.<a name="FNanchor_92_341" id="FNanchor_92_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_341" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> wee finde here about 4 degrees variation, but downe
in 35 and 40 wee had 11 and 12 and 13 degrees variation. wee weir
something fearfull of Halling to close into shore, being not
acquainted did not know what danger might be, yett would very
willingly have save [seen?] the Land, that wee might have beene the
better satisfied where we weir. twas very thick weather, that wee
could seldom take an observation. we Indeavord to make the Cape Horne
but we weir gott so far to the Southwards.<a name="FNanchor_93_342" id="FNanchor_93_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_342" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Yett we beleive we weir
not very farr off shore, for we had thousands of birds about us. the 9
day of December we had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span> a good observation and found our selves to be
in South lattd. 58&deg; 5&acute;. we had the winds att N.E. and N.E. and b.N.,
fine handsome topp saile gailes, sometimes a shower of Snow and
Sleete, but miserable colde. now our wines and brandy stand us in
greate Steade and is the thing under god that keepes us alive. we
stands to the Southward, haling S.E. and S.E. and B.E. After wee had
our last observation, which was 58&deg; 5&acute;, when we thought by our Dead
reconning that we weir in the lattd. of 60 or better, wee Steerd away
due East.<a name="FNanchor_94_343" id="FNanchor_94_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_343" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> we had but little Night, the Daylight was hardly shett
in att all. we standing to the Eastwards saw 3 or 4 greate Islands of
Ice and Snow, as we thought, of a good high and very colde about them.
from this Cape their are lying 3 or 4 Islands called the Berlingos,
which I am to think are those wee tooke to be the Islands of Ice, for
thay are all kiver'd with Snow, and the Burlingos lyeth by the globe
in the lattd. of 59&deg; 00&acute;.<a name="FNanchor_95_344" id="FNanchor_95_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_344" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> One Night as wee weare getting about the
land, some men gott merry, Especially the capt. and his Mess, which
caused some words to arise between the capt. and Some of the company,
in so much that thay fell to blowes, but the capt. runns into his
cabbon and fetches out a Pistoll laden, and comeing to one of Our
Peopple, by name Richard Hendricks, fier'd itt off as he thought att
his Head, but itt pleased god itt mist his head and grased on his
neck. the next morning wee found the shott placed in one of the Dead
Eyes of the maine shroudes, which was but Jus[t] behinde him. the
capt. thought he had kil'd the man, cryed out, "Armes, their was one
dead," and he would have kill more, which cabbon mess ran and fetched
their Armes forthwith,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span> and those that weir awake, was fetching theirs
likewise, which had not been soberer then others and more discretion
in them Sharpe had certainly been kill'd. it had likt to have been a
bad buisness, but when the[se] things came to an understandings All
was husht upp, Especially findeing the man was not so much hurt as wee
did suppos and was cured in a weeks time. Well, we stears away East,
till we thought we Had Easting enough to enter the Streights of Maria.
Now we begins to Hall to the Norwards E.N.E., and by observation taken
we found our selves to be gott to the norwards into 57&deg; 8&acute;. then we
halls away N.E. and about 4 days after had another very good
observation. then we found our Selves to be in 50&deg; So. lattd. Shott to
the Norwards of these new Streights, doubled about all the Lands;
aboundance of birds attends us Still. Wee are now gotten to the
Streights Mouth of Magelen, the North side. wee had good Fresh gales

the mate of a Shipp which lay att the olde rode to carry us as close
in as he could for which he was very well sattisfied. wee could not
have any permission to come in, neither any deniall, but after some
commanders of March't-men came on borde and desierd our Capt. to goe
for England, he was easy perswaided, thay telling him twould be the
makeing of him; so he came on the deck and bid Every man shift for
himself, for he would goe for England himself; upon which every man
packt upp whatt he had, some for olde England, some for Jamaica, other
for New Engl. everyone tooke his way, onely 7 men abord that had lost
their Voyage,<a name="FNanchor_106_355" id="FNanchor_106_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_355" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> so the capt. and Company thoug[ht] good to give

St. Thomases,<a name="FNanchor_108_357" id="FNanchor_108_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_357" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> haveing but 7 hands on borde, and a shipp giveing
chace to them so that thay loosed all their saile, and was much putt
to itt for the hands, but comein a brest of St. Thomases saw the
Harbor very Plaine, and to be sure we went into a small Harbor a mile
to leeward of the Fort. we wear tolde att Antegua that thiss was a
free Port for Eight years, which we found to be so.<a name="FNanchor_109_358" id="FNanchor_109_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_358" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span> governor
gave us Liberty to come in, and the next day sent out hands to bring
us in to the right harbor, under Commd. of the forte. the next day our
cable brake and she drave ashore; but not being willing to loose her,
gott her off with one Anchor and cable off, and one end of a cable
ashore, and so gott her into the Soft woose,<a name="FNanchor_110_359" id="FNanchor_110_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_359" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> because wee would
not be att the charge of Negro's and to pumpe her. thus the good shipp
<i>Trinity</i>, which was Built in the South Seas, ended her Voyage, and
through the Blessing of god brought us amounge our Cuntry men againe,
and thiss being what I can think on att present, being the true

years, till in March, 1684, when Capt. Edward Davis, in the

the island. William Dampier and several others of Captain Sharp's crew
were now with Davis. They bethought them of William, and found and
rescued him. Dampier, <i>New Voyage</i>, I. 84-87, describes the
Crusoe-like expedients by which the ingenious William maintained
himself. He was not the first precursor of Selkirk on the island, for
Ringrose, p. 119, says that the pilot of their ship told this present
crew of buccaneers "that many years ago a certain ship was cast away
upon this Island, and onely one man saved, who lived alone upon the
Island five years before any ship came this way to carry him off."
Several of Davis's men lived there three years, 1687-1690. Selkirk's
stay was in 1704-1709.</p></div>

one of them was saved, the rest being left in the prize when she was
turned adrift. Later, when Sharp's men reached the West Indies, a
shrewd trader there, perceiving this remaining pig to be silver, took
it off their hands, and then sold it for a round sum; whereupon deep
chagrin fell upon the pirates, who had duped themselves by abandoning
a rich cargo of silver. It will however be observed in <a href="#DOC_46">document 46</a>

almost as accurately as it is now done, but they had very imperfect
means of determining longitudes. These pirates, of course, had no
chronometer. The best they could do was to keep account each day of
the courses and estimated distances that they sailed, to reduce this
to numbers of miles eastward and westward in different latitudes
(their "eastings" and "westings"), measured from their last known
position, Duke of York Island, and from these computations to deduce
their probable longitude. It appears from Ringrose's fuller statements
that they were several hundred miles out of their reckoning when they
sighted Barbados.</p></div>

48, quotes from a letter of Governor Esmit, May 17, 1682, in the
Danish archives at Copenhagen, regarding our seven remaining pirates:
"There arrived here February 8 a ship of unknown origin, some two
hundred tons in size, without guns, passport, or letters, and with
seven men, French, English, and German. On being questioned they
replied that they had gone out of Espaniola from the harbor of Petit
Guava with two hundred men and a French commission to cruise on the
Spaniards.... [Summary of adventures on the Isthmus and in the South
Sea.] I bought what little cacao they had; the rest of their plunder
they brought ashore and divided among our people. The ship was no
longer usable. I have decided not to confiscate it, in order to avoid
any unfriendliness with sea-robbers. The inhabitants of St. Thomas
have decided that the said seven men shall remain among them". Later,
Captain Sharp himself came and spent his last years at St. Thomas.</p></div>

lieutenant-governor of Jamaica from 1674 to 1688, and at the time of

years had been the most famous of buccaneers, capturing Portobello in
1668, Maracaibo in 1669, Panama itself in 1671&mdash;wonderful exploits,
carried out with great bravery and cruelty. Now he is governor, holds
piracy in abhorrence, and is determined to suppress it! It must be
remembered, however, that his own exploits were carried out under
commissions from proper authority, and legally were not piracy. His
correspondent, Sir Leoline Jenkins, for twenty years judge of the High
Court of Admiralty, and at this time also secretary of state, was one
of the most learned admiralty lawyers England ever produced. Morgan's
view of his own competence as admiralty judge in his colony is given
with engaging frankness in a contemporary letter: "The office of Judge
Admiral was not given me for my understanding of the business better
than others, nor for the profitableness thereof, for I left the
schools too young to be a great proficient either in that or other
laws, and have been much more used to the pike than to the book; and
as for the profit, there is no porter in this town but can get more
money in the time than I made by this trial. But I was truly put in to
maintain the honour of the Court for His Majesty's service." <i>Cal. St.

brandy, pigs of tin,<a name="FNanchor_2_365" id="FNanchor_2_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_365" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and artichokes, with 24 passengers and all,
they met off Cabo Pasado, about halfway in their voyage, a ship, the
<i>Trinidad</i>, and supposed it to be Spanish, but when they perceived
that it was a ship of pirates, they tried to obtain the weather-gauge,
but the pirates obtained it, and then they began to fire musket-shots,
and with the first three shots they killed the captain of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
<i>Rosario</i>, who was called Juan Lopez, and fired other shots, and
captured the ship, and took out with the hooks [?] all that they
deemed necessary of the wine and brandy, and all the silver and other
things that had value, and tortured two Spaniards in order to learn
whether there was more silver, and cut down the sails and rigging,
except the mainsail, and turned the ship adrift with the men,
excepting five or six whom they took with them, and among others the
deponent.</p>

<p>Thence they went to the Isla de la Plata, where they remained three
days and a half refreshing themselves, and suspecting that the
prisoners were planning to rise and take the ship they killed one and
flogged another; and thence they went to Payta, where they sent two
canoes ashore with 32 armed men, with design to capture Payta, but
meeting with resistance they returned to the ship. Thence they sailed
away to the Strait of Magellan, but did not go through it, but around
the Isla del Fuego, which was some six or eight days' distance from
the Strait of Magellan. In making this passage of Fuego, to enter into
the North Sea, they were delayed some nine days. They came to
Barbados, where, because of finding there a ship of the King of
England, they did not venture to enter.</p>

<p>On the voyage they divided the booty and obtained 400 dollars apiece,
for each one of 74 persons.</p>

<p>From Barbados they went to Antigua, where they were received without
injury, but rather with good treatment, and from there they divided,
some going to Nevis in a bilander,<a name="FNanchor_3_366" id="FNanchor_3_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_366" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> others, some 18 of them, to

of them, that were the principal chiefs, were called, [the one]
Captain Sharp, and the other Gilbert Dike; and this deponent was left
at Plymouth.</p>

<span xml:lang="de">"Brandenburg-Preussen auf der Westk&uuml;ste von Afrika, 1681 bis 1721"</span>, in
Heft 6 of the <span xml:lang="de"><i>Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften</i></span> of the German
General Staff (Berlin, 1885), pp. 102-105. In the First
Brandenburg-Prussian fleet that ever sailed out of the Baltic (August,
1680), one of the six frigates was the <i>Churprintz</i> (Kurprinz,
Electoral Prince), 32 guns, Capt. Cornelius Reers, and there was a
fire-ship, the <i>Salamander</i>, 2 guns, Capt. Marsilius (or Marcellus)
Cock; the captains were probably all Dutch. The chief exploit of the
squadron was to capture, in time of peace, a ship of the Spanish royal
navy, which thus became the first of the elector's ships actually
owned by him. Then Reers and a squadron of four frigates and the
<i>Salamander</i> sailed to the West Indies, and spent the winter of
1680-1681 in cruising against Spanish shipping, though with little
success. If Samuel Button's story is true (<a href="#DOC_48">document 48</a>), it would seem
that the original <i>Salamander</i> must have been lost, and the <i>William
and Anne</i> substituted in its place and renamed. The squadron got back
to Prussia in May, 1681.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_379" id="Footnote_1_379"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_379">[1]</a> This very curious document (for one does not expect to
find pirates agreeing in writing to pursue a course of piracy) is
found embedded in one of the indictments in the case of the
<i>Camelion</i>, in vol. I. of the wills in the office of the surrogate,
New York City, pp. 312-313 of the modern copy. Its presence among
wills requires a word of explanation. The governor of a royal colony
was usually chancellor, ordinary, and vice-admiral, and as such might
preside in the courts of chancery, probate, and admiralty&mdash;courts
whose common bond was that their jurisprudence was derived from the
civil (or Roman) law, and not from the common law. Most of his
judicial action was in testamentary cases. It was therefore not
unnatural that the few admiralty cases and cases of piracy tried in
these early days should be recorded in the same volume as the wills,
though distinguished by the simple process of turning the book end for
end and recording them at the back. In this case the record begins
with our <a href="#DOC_51">document 51</a>; but the present document, copied into one of the
indictments, is earlier in date. The substance of another pirates'
agreement (Roberts's company, 1720, see <a href="#DOC_117">doc. no. 117</a>) is given in
Charles Johnson, <i>General History of the Pyrates</i>, second ed., pp.
230-232; another (Phillips's company, 1727, see <a href="#DOC_120">doc. no. 120</a> and

usual forme", October 3, 1682, is recorded in the Public Record
Office, London, C.O. 5:1182, p. 40. James, duke of York, was Lord High
Admiral from 1660 to 1673; he was proprietor of the province of New
York from 1664 till he became king in 1685. As Lord High Admiral, he
issued commissions to the colonial governors appointing them as his
vice-admirals. That which he issued, January 26, 1667, to Lord
Willoughby, governor of Barbados, is printed in the <i>Publications</i> of
the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, II. 187-198. That to Dongan,
issued by James in 1682, when, though excluded from office in England,
he was still Lord High Admiral of the crown's dominions, was no doubt
similar. At this early period the governor himself sometimes acted as
judge; see <a href="#DOC_46">document 46</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_361">note 1</a>. Strictly speaking, what was here
appointed was not a court of admiralty but a commission for the trial
of piracy and other felonies. By the statute 28 Henry VIII. c. 15
(1536), it was provided that cases of piracy should be tried within
the realm, not by the High Court of Admiralty, but before commissions
specially appointed for the purpose, and with the aid of a jury. But
this statute did not extend to the plantations, and until the passage
of the act of 11 and 12 William III. c. 7 (1700), commissioners for
the trial of piracy in the colonies were usually appointed by
governors in their capacity as vice-admirals, and proceeded under the
civil (Roman) law, not the statute. Another commission, for the trial
of piracy (to Governor Bellomont and others, Nov. 23, 1701) is printed
in E.C. Benedict, <i>The American Admiralty</i>, third ed., pp. 73-79,
fourth ed., pp. 70-76; another (1716) is <a href="#DOC_106">doc. no. 106</a>, below; another
(to Governor Woodes Rogers, Bahamas, Dec. 5, 1718), is in Johnson's
<i>History of the Pyrates</i>, II. (1726) 337-340; a fourth (1728) is in
<i>N.J. Archives</i>, first series, V. 196. See also <a href="#DOC_201">doc. no. 201</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_1372">note 1</a>,

Treacherous and Pyratticall manner by certain Rovers or pirates (moste
of them theire Majest[ies] Subjects) in the Road of the Isle of May of
the Cape de verd Islands upon the Fourth day of February Anno Dmi
1690/1, The said Shipp with what goods were on board her properly
belonging unto Coll. Sam'll Shrimpton<a name="FNanchor_2_391" id="FNanchor_2_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_391" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Merchant att Boston in New

<p>Upon the twentyeighth day of January 1690/1 wee arrived from the
Island of Madara att said Island of May aforesd and came to Anchor in
the Road there. The next day our men went ashore and applyed
themselves to rake togeather of salt in the Salt Pounds in order to
the loading our Said Shipp and Soe continued workeing severall days.
And upon the first day of February following there came into the
aforesaid Road a Sloope weareing theire Majesties Collours and
anchored not farr [fro]m our Said Shipp who tould us they came from
South Carolina, theire Captn. one James Allison formerly of New Yorke,
and that they had a Com'n from the Governor of Carolina aforesaid to
take and Indamage the French, for which end they were here arrived
expecting they might in a Short time meete Some of them.<a name="FNanchor_3_392" id="FNanchor_3_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_392" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The said

wee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span> were with the said Shipp about twelve mounthes Since, Loadeing
Loggwood, parte whereof wee bought of them and fully Sattisfied them
for, and during our stay there kept amicable correspondance with us,
Eateing, Drinking and Lodging frequently on board our said Shipp,
which wee gladly consented unto in regard they might have beene a
defence and help to us if any Enimey had assaulted us, by reason of
which former friendshipp and good Correspondance as alsoe theire
Specious pretence of a Commission against our Enimies (which wee woere
in Some feares of) wee willingly continued the former kindnesse and
amity betweene us, hopeing if wee were assaulted by the French wee
might by theire assistance (they being thirty five able men and our
Shipp being of pretty good force) have beene capable to make a good
resistance, They often protesting and promiseing to Stand by and help
us to the uttmost if there Should be occasion. wee therefore not
doubting theire honesty and Sincerity permitted them frequently to
come on board our Said Shipp, and Sometimes Some of us went on board
theire Sloope, and Believeing ourselves secure and willing to make a
quick dispatch as possible in Loading our Shipp, wee sent all [hands]
to worke in the Pounds (as wee [had done (?)] he[retof]ore) Except our
[Carpenter]s, which were [then (?)] att worke on our Decke building
[a] Boate for the more Convenient carriage of salt. Thus wee continued
workeing, and upon the Fourth day of February instant Capt. Allison
and Sundry of his men Dined with us on board said Shipp in a friendly
manner, as they were wont to doe, and Some time after Dinner desired
the said Commander Tay, with Mr. Edward Tyng the Sup[er]cargoe and
James Meeres a passenger, to goe on boarde theire Sloope to Drinke a
glasse of Punch with them, which he did, and when we were come on
board the said Sloope they pretended theire Doctor (whom wee Left on
board the Shipp talkeing with our men) had the keys where theire Sugar
was, Soe they could not make the Punch, and forthwith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span> severall of
them Stept into the Boate and Rowdd on board our Shipp to fetch the
keys. as Soone as they entred our Shipp one of them Ran to the
Steereage Doore and another to the Round house and Secured all our
Arms, the rest Imediatly Seizeing the Carpenters who were att work on
the Boate. They then fired a gunn as a Signall to theire Sloope, who
Imediatly Seized us who were on board her (wee being unarmed) and
forthwith way'd anchor and Laid our Shipp aboard, att the same time
takeing everything out of the Sloope, excepting a Little Stincking
Brackish water, some Flower, a Little Stincking beefe, and three or
foure baggs of wheate, and then Comanded us presently to putt of from
the Shipp about Musquett Shott and then to come to anchor, which we
were forced to Comply with; After which they went on Shore and fetched
our men out of the Pounds by force and Armes, Seaventeene of whom they
tooke with them, Some whereof by force and threattnings and others of
them went volluntarily, which wee have good reason to beleive were
privy to the Plott and Surpriseall of the Shipp, a List of whose names
is hereto Subjoyned. afterward they gave us our Chests and some of our
Cloaths and the next day Comanded us to Saile away with the said
Sloope (which they gave us), and upon the Sixth day of February
Instant wee sailed with said Sloope for the Island of Barbados where

petition is addressed, not to the king in Council, but to the lords
justices who were exercising his functions during the absence of
William III. in Holland, whither he had gone on account of his war
with Louis XIV. The paper is endorsed as read July 16, 1696. A
proclamation was immediately issued, July 18, declaring Henry Every
and his crew pirates, ordering colonial governors to seize them, and
offering a reward of &pound;500, which the East India Company agreed to pay,
for their apprehension; <i>Acts of the Privy Council, Colonial</i>, II.
299-302. Several of the crew were apprehended, tried, and hanged in
November; their trial is reported in Hargrave's <i>State Trials</i>, V.
1-18. Others found a refuge in the colonies, despite the proclamation,
Governor Markham of Pennsylvania in particular being loudly accused of
connivance; <i>Calendar of State Papers, Colonial</i>, 1696-1697, pp.
613-615. Every (or Avery) was one of the most famous of the pirates.
His history is told in Captain Charles Johnson's <i>General History of
the Pyrates</i> (second ed., London, 1724), pp. 45-63. Two popular
ballads respecting him are in Professor Firth's <i>Naval Songs and
Ballads</i>, pp. 131-134. We print first the documents which first
brought knowledge of his misdeeds, but the whole story in a
consecutive order is better found in the examination of John Dann,

<p>Extract of a Clause in the Generall Letter from Bombay dated the 28th
May, 1695.</p>

<p>By our shipping now arrived who touched at Johanna Wee have News That
Strongs ship which was one of them that w[ent] for the Spanish
Expedition is runn away with from the Groyn<a name="FNanchor_2_411" id="FNanchor_2_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_411" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and come into these
seas carrying 46 Guns and 130 men, as your Honours will perceive by
Copy of the Captains Letter left at Johanna that accompanyes this.
Your Honours Ships going into that Island gave him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span> chase, but hee was
too nimble for them by much, having taken down a great deal of his
upper work and made her exceeding snugg, which advantage being added
to her well sailing before, causes her to sail so hard now that shee
fears not who follows her. This Ship will undoubtedly into the Red
Seas and Wee fear disappoint us of Our above expected Goods, And it is
probable will after shee had ransacked that Gulph proceed to Persia
and doe what mischief possible there, which will procure infinite
clamours at Suratt and the Government will be for embargoing all that
ever Wee have there.</p>

<p>By Letters received the 4th of this Inst. from the Generall<a name="FNanchor_2_413" id="FNanchor_2_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_413" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
Councill for the English Affairs residing att Bombay dated 12th
October 1695 the Company are advised as followeth, vizt.</p>

<p>That on the 29th August the Generall and Councill dispatched the
Company's ship the <i>Benjamin</i>, Burthen 468 Tunns, Captain Brown
Commander, in Company of two Dutch ships that wintered here, for
Surrat, with almost all the Cargoes of the three ships, except the
Lead that the <i>Mocha</i> carryed in her for Persia (which wee had nott
time to take out, she arriving so late). On the 7th of September she
arrived Surrat Rivers mouth, where the President, according to Orders,
fell to unlading her, but by that time they had gott the Guns, 4 or
500 Bales, and some other Goods on shoar, on the 11th Ditto, One of
Abdull Gofores<a name="FNanchor_3_414" id="FNanchor_3_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_414" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span> Ships arriving, their people sent the Governour
word, that they were plundered by an English Vessell, severall of
their Men killed in fight, and others barbarously used; Upon which
there was a great noise in Towne, and the Rabble very much incensed
against the English, which caused the Governour to send a Guard to Our
Factory to prevent their doing any violence to Our People. the 13th in
the Morning, the <i>Gunsway</i>, one of the Kings Ships, arrived from Judda
and Mocho,<a name="FNanchor_4_415" id="FNanchor_4_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_415" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the Nocqueda<a name="FNanchor_5_416" id="FNanchor_5_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_416" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Merchants, with one voice,
proclaiming that they were robbed by four English Ships near Bombay of
a very great Sume, and that the Robbers had carryed their plundered
Treasure on Shoar there, on which there was farr greater noise than
before. upon this the Governour<a name="FNanchor_6_417" id="FNanchor_6_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_417" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> sent a very strong Guard to the
Factory and clapt all our People in Irons, shut them up in a room,
planked up all their windows, kept strict Watches about them, that no
one should have pen, ink, or paper to write, stopped all the passages,
that no Letters might pass to Us. att this time Captain Brown being
att Surat, with some of his Officers and Boats Crew, faired in Common
with the rest, and so did some others, that were on shoar, to look
after their sick att Swally;<a name="FNanchor_7_418" id="FNanchor_7_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_418" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and their Long boat and Pinnace going
on Shoar there, for Water and Provisions, They sent one Man to the
Choultrey,<a name="FNanchor_8_419" id="FNanchor_8_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_419" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to inquire what News, (having heard somewhat of the
Rumour). this person they seized on, by severall Peons, which caused
them immediately to putt their boats off, which they had no sooner
done, but sundry small Armes were discharged at them. This Caused the
Boats to repair to their Ship, att the Rivers mouth, where the Dutch
told them, they durst not supply them with any thing while there. But
one of them, being ready to sail for Batavia, said, if they would sail
in Company with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span> them, they would supply them with what they wanted,
as soon as they were out of sight of the Rivers Mouth, which was done
according to promise, and so the <i>Benjamin</i>, by the Generall Consent
of their Officers, came hither, having left her Captain and thirty
nine more of her Company behind. as soon as we had a full relation of
these things, we immediately wrote to Court, to one Issa Cooley, an
Armenian, whom wee intend to make our Vakeel<a name="FNanchor_9_420" id="FNanchor_9_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_420" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to represent Our Cause
to the King, and to Excuse Our Selves from being concerned in those
barbarous Actions. Wee Also wrote to the Governour of Surrat and all
the Great Umbraws<a name="FNanchor_10_421" id="FNanchor_10_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_421" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> round Us to the same effect, hearing by all that
come from Surrat, that that Citty is in an uproar about Us, and being
informed also, that Severall Letters are gone to the Siddy<a name="FNanchor_11_422" id="FNanchor_11_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_422" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (who is
very near Us with an Army) from Court and Surat, wee are making what
preparation Wee can for our Own defence, nott knowing what this
Extream ferment may produce.</p>

<p>On the 28th past, We received a Letter from the President and Councill
by the Governour's permission, Coppy of which is enclosed with a Coppy
of Our Answer. Wee have also wrote the Governour a Second time and the
Vockanavis, Cozze and Hurcorra,<a name="FNanchor_12_423" id="FNanchor_12_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_423" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and have sent a Letter to the
King, Asset Cawn, and the Cozyse<a name="FNanchor_13_424" id="FNanchor_13_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_424" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> att Court, endeavouring as much
as possible to allay the heat, by clearing our innocency, and have
promised that if Our Shipping arrives according to Expectation, that
wee will send one or two next Season to Mocho and Judda to convoy
their Fleet.</p>

<p>Wee are informed, that one English man in Surrat carrying to Prison,
was so wounded by the Rabble, that he dyed three days after, and that
severall others were barbarously used. it is certain the Pyrates,
which these People affirm were all English, did do very barbarously by
the People of the <i>Gunsway</i> and Abdul Gofors Ship, to make them
confess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span> where their Money was, and there happened to be a great
Umbraws Wife (as Wee hear) related to the King, returning from her
Pilgrimage to Mecha, in her old age. She they abused very much, and
forced severall other Women, which Caused one person of Quality, his
Wife and Nurse, to kill themselves to prevent the Husbands seing them
(and their being) ravished. All this will raise a black Cloud att
Court, which We wish may not produce a severe storme.</p>

<p>The Pyrates, being neglected of all hands, begin to grow formidable,
and if some Course be nott taken to destroy them, they will yearly
increase, having found their trade so beneficiall, and how soon the
Companys servants, as well as their Trade, may be sacrificed to
revenge the Quarrell of the Sufferers, they know not.</p>

small Vessell of about 30 tuns, whereof he had no account till the
14th, upon which he immediately went thither, and only found the
Master, whom they call Captain Thomas Hollinsworth, and two men more
on board. That they had no other Loading but Gold and Silver, which
they conveyd away, and sold the Ship to one Thomas Yeeden and Lawrence
Deane of Gallway, Merchants. It was a very considerable Sume they had,
of which Mr. Bell desires the Government may be informd, that he may
have further direction therein; And adds that he found two baggs of
about Forty pound worth of Mony not passable in this Kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_4_431" id="FNanchor_4_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_431" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in
the hands of the said Mr. Yeeden and Mr. Dean, and took their Bond of
a hundred pound to have the same forthcomeing to answer the
Governments pleasure.</p>

<p>The said Mr. Bell in his Letter of the 20th of June further says, That
since the writing of the above Letter he mett two of the Crew
belonging to the said Vessell, by name, James Trumble and Edward
Foreside, in whose hands he found about 200 l., and seizd on their
persons and goods, but found none of the said Guilt or Bullion in

and hopes to find a great deale more of the said Guilt and Bullion in
the Country, or those that carry it away, the common report being that
the said Ship was worth Twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span> Thousand pounds in Gold, Silver and
Bullion; And further adds That he receivd a Warrant from Sir Henry

<p>Mr. Farmer Glover, Generall Supervisor of the Revenue, in his Letter
of the 25th of June from Gallway says, That having had some Account of
a sloop being putt into Westport he hastned thither, but she was gon
thence (the day before he gott there) towards Gallway; On examinacion
he found she came from New Providence in America by Cocquett<a name="FNanchor_6_433" id="FNanchor_6_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_433" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> from
thence, had on board Three Tunn and a half of Brazelett<a name="FNanchor_7_434" id="FNanchor_7_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_434" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Wood and a

Westport says he dischargd at one time 32 baggs and one Cask of Mony,
each as much as a man could well lift from the ground; That there are
severall Reports in the Country, some saying she was a Privateer,
others a Buckaneer, or that she had Landed some of the
Assassinators,<a name="FNanchor_8a_436" id="FNanchor_8a_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_8a_436" class="fnanchor">[8a]</a> which no doubt but their way of comeing into the
Country gave great cause of Suspition, for as soon as they had Landed
they offerd any Rates for Horses&mdash;Ten pounds for a Garran<a name="FNanchor_9_437" id="FNanchor_9_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_437" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> not

were at Foxford to examin that matter, but there is a Summons left at
his house to appear at Gallway on Munday next to give his Testimony

Glover has taken them from the officer and deliverd them into the
Custom House. As for the 14 pound &frac34; worth of Silver bought by the
Officer, it is in Charge with the Collector Mr. Vanderlure. No
question but the Master of the Sloop hath forfeited and been lyable to

severall large baggs belonging to the Passengers. what was in the
baggs he cannot tell, but that they were stuffed full of something.

<p>The Examination of John Dann of Rochester, Mariner, taken the 3d of
August 1696.</p>

<p>Danns Examination.</p>

<p>This Informant saith that 3 yeares agoe he was Coxwain in the
<i>Soldado</i> Prize, That he deserted the said shipp to goe in Sir James
Houblons<a name="FNanchor_2_445" id="FNanchor_2_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_445" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Service, upon an Expedition to the West Indies, under Don
Authuro Bourne. hee went on board the <i>James</i>, Captain Gibson
Commander, and the whole Company shifted their Ship in the Hope, and
went on board the <i>Charles</i> in which they went to the Corunna. The
Shipps Company mutinied at Corunna for want of their pay, there being
8 months due to them; some of the men proposed to Captain Every, who
was master<a name="FNanchor_3_446" id="FNanchor_3_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_446" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the <i>Charles</i>, to carry away the Shipp, which was
agreed on and sworne too; accordingly they sayled from the Corunna the
7th of May 1693.<a name="FNanchor_4_447" id="FNanchor_4_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_447" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> when they were gone out they made up about 85 men.
Then they asked Captain Gibson, the Commander, whether he was willing
to goe with them, which he refusing, they sett him a shoar, with 14 or
15 more.</p>

<p>The first place they came to was the Isle of May,<a name="FNanchor_5_448" id="FNanchor_5_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_448" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> where they mett
three English Ships and tooke some provisions out of them, with an
Anchor and Cable and about 9 men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span> They went next to the Coast of
Guinea, and there they tooke about 5 li. of Gold Dust, under the
pretence of Trade; from Guinea they went to Philandepo,<a name="FNanchor_6_449" id="FNanchor_6_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_449" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> where they
cleaned their ship and tooke her lower; from thence they went to
Princes Island,<a name="FNanchor_7_450" id="FNanchor_7_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_450" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> where they mett with 2 Deanes<a name="FNanchor_8_451" id="FNanchor_8_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_451" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> ships, which they
tooke after some restraine. in those Shipps they tooke some small
Armes, Chestes of Lynnen and perpetuenes,<a name="FNanchor_9_452" id="FNanchor_9_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_452" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with about 40 l. in Gold
dust and a great quantity of Brandy. they putt them on shoar Except 18
or 20 they tooke with them. they carryed the best of the Danes Shipps
with them and burnt the other. They stood then for Cape Lopez, and in
the way mett with a small portugeese, laden with slaves from Angola.
they tooke some Cloathes and silkes from them and gave them some
provisions which they were in want of. att Cape Lopaz they only bought
Honey, and sunke the little shipp, the men not being satisfied with
the Commander. They went next to Annabo<a name="FNanchor_10_453" id="FNanchor_10_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_453" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and takeing provisions
there they doubled the Cape and sailed to Madagascar, where they tooke
more provisions and cleared the ship. from thence they sailed to
Johanna,<a name="FNanchor_11_454" id="FNanchor_11_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_454" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> where they mett a small Junke, put her a shore and tooke
40 peices out of her, and had one of their men killed. they only tooke
in provisions at Johanna. Three English Merchant ships came downe
thither at the same time, but they did not speake with them. They went
thence to a place called Paddy,<a name="FNanchor_12_455" id="FNanchor_12_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_455" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and soe back to Johanna, touching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
at Comora by the way, where they tooke in provisions. at Johanna they
tooke a Junke laden with Rice, which they stood in need of; here they
tooke in 13 French men that had been privateering in those Seas under
English Colours and had lost their ship at Molila, where it was cast
away. Then they resolved to goe for the Red Sea. in the way they mett
with two English Privateers, the one called the <i>Dolphin</i>, the other
<i>Portsmouth Adventure</i>. The <i>Dolphin</i>, Captaine Want Comander, was a
Spanish Bottom, had 60 men on board and was fitted out at the
Orkells<a name="FNanchor_13_456" id="FNanchor_13_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_456" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> neare Philadelphia. She came from thence about 2 yeares
agoe last January. The <i>Portsmouth Adventure</i> was fitted out at Rhode
Island about the same time, Captain Joseph Faro Comander. this ship
had about the like number of men and about 6 Gunns each and they
joyned Company. They came to an Island called Liparan,<a name="FNanchor_14_457" id="FNanchor_14_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_457" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> at the
entrance into the Red Sea, about June last was 12 months. they lay
there one night and then 3 sale more of English came to them, One
comanded by Thomas Wake<a name="FNanchor_15_458" id="FNanchor_15_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_458" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> fitted out from Boston in New England,
another the <i>Pearle</i> Brigantine, William Mues Comander, fitted out of
Rhode Island, the third was the <i>Amity</i> Sloop, Thomas Tew
Comander,<a name="FNanchor_16_459" id="FNanchor_16_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_459" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> fitted out at New Yorke. they had about 6 Guns each. two
of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span> had 50 men on board and the Brigantine betweene 30 and 40.
they all Joyned in partnership, agreeing Captain Every should be the
Comander. After they had laine there some time they were apprehensive
the Moors shipps would not come downe from Mocha,<a name="FNanchor_16a_460" id="FNanchor_16a_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_16a_460" class="fnanchor">[16a]</a> soe they sent a
pinnace thither, which tooke two Boates. they brought away 2 men,
which told them the shipps must come downe. In the meane time they
stood into the sea about 3 Leagues and came to an Anchor there, and
hearing by the Pinnace the Moors Shipps were ready to come downe they
weighed and stood to Leparon againe. After they had lain there 5 or 6
dayes the Moores shipps (being about 25 in number) past by them in the
night unseen, though the passage was not above 2 miles over. they<a name="FNanchor_17_461" id="FNanchor_17_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_461" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
was in August last on Saturday night. the next morning they saw a
Ketch comeing downe, which they tooke, and by them they heard the
ships were gone by, whereupon it was resolved they should all follow
them and accordingly they wheighed on Monday, but the <i>Dolphin</i> being
an ill sayler they burnt her and tooke the men most of them aboard
Captain Every and the Brigantine they tooke in two [tow]. the sloop
fell asterne and never came up to them. Captain Wake likewise lagged
behind but came up to them afterwards. the <i>Portsmouth</i> kept them
company. they steered their Course for Suratt, whether the Moores
ships were bound. about 3 dayes before they made Cape St. John<a name="FNanchor_18_462" id="FNanchor_18_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_462" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
they mett with one of the Moores ships, betweene 2 and 300 tons, with
6 Guns, which they tooke, she haveing fired 3 shott. they tooke about
50 or 60,000 l. in that ship in Silver and gold, and kept her with
them till they made the land, and comeing to an anchor they espied
another ship. they made sale up to her. she had about 40 Guns mounted
and as they said 800 men. Shee stood a fight of 3 houres and then
yeilded, the men runing into the Hold and there they made their
Voyage. They tooke out of that ship soe much Gold and Silver in Coyned
money and Plate as made up each mans share with what they had taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
before about 1000 l. a man, there being 180 that had their Dividents,
the Captain haveing a Double share and the Master a share and a halfe.
The <i>Portsmouth</i> did not come into the Fight and therefore had noe
Divident, but the Brigantine had, which was taken away from them
againe by reason that the <i>Charles's</i> men changing with them Silver
for Gold they found the Brigantine men Clippt the Gold, soe they left
them only 2000 peices of Eight to buy provisions. They gave a share to
the Captain of the <i>Portsmouth</i> and brought him away with them.
Captain Want went into his ship and sailed into the Gulph of Persia
and the Brigantine (he thinkes) went to the Coast of Ethiopia. Captain
Wake went to the Island of St. Maries near Madagascar,<a name="FNanchor_19_463" id="FNanchor_19_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_463" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> intending
for the Red Sea the next time the Moores ships were expected from
thence. Captain Every resolved to goe streight for the Island of
Providence. In the way the men mutinied, some being for carrying her
to Kian<a name="FNanchor_20_464" id="FNanchor_20_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_464" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> belonging to the French, neere Brazill, but Captain Every
withstood it, there being not above 20 men in the Shipp that Joyned
with him. when they came to the Island of Mascareen<a name="FNanchor_21_465" id="FNanchor_21_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_465" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> in the
Latitude of 21 they left as many men there as had a mind to stay in
that Island, and about March or Aprill last they arrived in the Island
of Providence with 113 men on board. they came first to an Anchor off
the Island of Thera,<a name="FNanchor_22_466" id="FNanchor_22_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_466" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and by a sloop sent a Letter to Nicholas
Trott, Governor of Providence,<a name="FNanchor_23_467" id="FNanchor_23_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_467" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to propose bringing their ship
thither if they might be assured of Protection and Liberty to goe
away, which he promised them. They made a collection of 20 peices of 8
a man and the Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span> 40, to present the Governor with, besides
Elephants Teeth and some other things to the value of about 1000 l.
Then they left their Ship which the Governor had and 46 Guns in her.
they bought a sloop which cost them 600 l. Captain Every and about 20
more came in her for England and Every tooke the name of Bridgman;
about 23 more of the men bought another Sloop and with the Master,
Captain Risby, and the rest of the men went for Carolina.</p>

<p>Captain Every alias Bridgman and this Informant landed at
Dumfaneky<a name="FNanchor_24_468" id="FNanchor_24_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_468" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in the North of Ireland towards the latter end of June

himselfe, 5 men more and 2 boyes, and came along with them to a place
called Lidderkenny,<a name="FNanchor_27_471" id="FNanchor_27_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_471" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and there he would have detained their money
but this Informant and another of the Company had liberty to goe to
Derry<a name="FNanchor_28_472" id="FNanchor_28_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_472" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> to cleere themselves to Captain Hawkins, but by the way
Cuttle agreed with them to lett them goe for three pounds weight in
Gold, which they gave him at a place called St. Johnstons,<a name="FNanchor_29_473" id="FNanchor_29_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_473" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and
then they had liberty to goe on to Dublin.</p>

<p>This Informant heard likewise that the said Cuttle made an agreement
with the other men before he lett them goe but he cannot tell what
they gave him.</p>

<p>This Informant came from Dublin about 3 weekes agoe and landed at
Holyhead and soe to London, where he arrived on Tuesday last. the man

<p>This informant sayes further that the wife of Adams, who was their
Quarter Master, came with them from the Island of Providence, that
shee was with Captain Every at Donoughedee and beleives they went over
together; as this Informant came to London hee saw this woman at St.
Albans, who was goeing into a stage Coach. She told this Informant
that shee was goeing to Captaine Bridgmans but would not tell him

everywhere with an ill reputation. Edward Randolph (Toppan, <i>Edward
Randolph</i>, V. 158) declares that from this present voyage he brought
&pound;10,000 in gold and silver into Rhode Island. He had gone out with a
privateering commission from Governor Fletcher of New York (<i>N.Y. Col.
Doc.</i>, IV. 310, etc.), though, according to Bellomont, Fletcher must
have known of his piratical habits. Fletcher in his not too satisfying
"defence" (<i>ibid.</i>, IV. 447) says: "This Tew appeared to me not only a
man of courage and activity, but of the greatest sence and remembrance
of what he had seen, of any seaman I had mett. He was allso what they
call a very pleasant man; soe that at some times when the labours of
my day were over it was some divertisement as well as information to
me, to heare him talke. I wish'd in my mind to make him a sober man,
and in particular to reclaime him from a vile habit of swearing. I
gave him a booke to that purpose." But it appears from paragraph 9 of
our <a href="#DOC_68">no. 68</a> that Tew was killed, in the act of piracy, within the year
of the issue of his commission, and it is impossible to say how far
the reformation of his speech had progressed.</p></div>

<p>Phillip Midleton of London, Mariner, of competent age, deposeth and
saith upon his Corporall Oath That he, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span> Deponent, did serve on
board the ship <i>Charles</i> alias <i>Fancy</i> under the command of Henry
Every alias Bridgeman in the month of Aprill last, when she arrived at
an Island near Providence in America, from whence a Letter was writ to
Mr. Nicholas Trott, Governour of Providence, which Letter this
Deponent saw and heard it read, and declareth That the Contents were,
That, provided he would give them liberty to come on Shoar and depart
when they pleased (or words to this purpose), they promised to give
the said Governour twenty Peices of Eight and two Peices of Gold a Man
and the said Ship, and all that was in her. But this Deponent
remembers not the least threatning expression in the said Letter nor
did he hear such like words from any of the Ships Crew, onely some of
them said that if they were not admitted to come to Providence they
would go some where else, and further deposeth That Mr. Governour
Trott returned answer to the aforesaid Letter in writeing in very
civill termes, assuring Captain Every That he and his Company should
be wellcome (or words to this purpose), which said assurance was made
good to them by Governour Trott after their arrivall at Providence as
effectually as they could desire.<a name="FNanchor_2_477" id="FNanchor_2_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_477" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This Deponent likewise deposeth,
That upon receipt of Mr. Governour Trotts Letter, or in a little space
of time after, a Collection was made afore the Mast (at which this
Deponent was present) for him the said Governour Trott, to which
Captain Every contributed 40 Peices of Eight and four Peices of Gold
and every Sailer (being one hundred men besides Boyes) twenty Peices
of Eight and two Peices of Gold a man, which sum being collected were
sent to Mr. Governour Trott by Robert Chinton, Henry Adams, and two
more, whose names this Deponent doth not call to mind, after which the
said Captain Every and his Crew sailed in the said ship <i>Charles</i> for
Providence, where at their arrivall they delivered up the said ship
with what was in her to the said Governour Trott, and accordingly
Major Trott took possession of her in the said Governours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span> name and
afterwards left her in the custody of the Governours Boatswain and a
few Negroes, whose incapacity or number were not sufficient to secure
the ship from hurtfull accidents, as this Deponent believes and also
was informed, the which was made evident by the ships comeing a shoar
about two dayes after Governour Trott was possessed of her, though she
had two Anchors at her Bow and one in the hold, at least she had so
many Anchors when this Deponent and the rest of the Company quitted
the said ship to Mr. Trott. This Deponent also deposeth That so soon
as Mr. Trott was in possession of the said ship he sent Boats to bring
a shoar the Elephants teeth, the sails, Blocks, etc., that was
valuable in the said Ship, And further saith That he saw severall
Boats Land which were filled with the aforesaid Commodityes and
stores, and that he hath heard severall of the Ship <i>Charles's</i> Crew
say and affirm (and which this Deponent also doth believe and partly
know) that at the said Ship's arrivall at Providence she had on board
fifty Tons of Elephants teeth, forty six Guns mounted, one hundred
Barrells of Gunpowder or thereabouts, severall Chests of Buccanneer
Guns, besides the small Armes which were for the Ships use, the number
of which doth not occur to his mind. He further deposeth to the best
of his knowledge and Information the said ship was firm and tight, for
whereas he went down into her Hold the same day she arrived at
Providence he then could not perceive she made the least water. And
further saith that the said Ship came a shoar as aforesaid two dayes
after Mr. Trott was possessed of her, he first having taken out of her
what was most considerable. this misfortune of the ship happened about
noon in the said Governour's sight, as this Deponent (who was an Eye
Witness) well knowes. he likewise declares That one named James
Browne, with severall others of Providence and also severall that had
been of the Ships Crew, upon this occasion profered themselves to
undertake weighing her with Casks, But this Deponent never heard that
the offers aforesaid were accepted, nor that any means was used to get
her off, nor that Governour Trott had any consideration besides that
of getting on Shoar what still re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>mained on board. This Deponent also
saith That it was generally reported at Providence the Ship was run on
Shoar designedly. And this Deponent saith That he left Providence when
Captain Every did and that the Sloop in which they went was the last
Vessell that carryed from Providence any considerable number of the
ship <i>Charles's</i> men and that this Deponent was informed a Packet was
sent by Hollandsworths Sloop, which sailed before that in which this
Deponent was, in which also he knowes there was another Packet sent,
which this Deponent saw and believes 't was from Governour Trott but
knowes not to whom they were directed. He further deposeth That
neither while he was at Providence nor afterwards he knew or heard
that the said ship <i>Charles</i> was bilged, but he remembers that Joseph
Dawson, who had been Quarter-Master by Captain Every, was sent on
board her just before his departure to fetch some Cask for the use of
his Sloop, which Dawson brought on Shoar and then in this Deponents
hearing declared That the said ship was not bilged, the water in her
being black and stinking and the Cask being wedged in the Ballast. if
the Ship had been bilged she would have been full of water whereby he
could not have gotten the Cask out. And this Deponent alwaies
understood That Sir James Houblon and Company of London owned the said
Ship and verily believes Governour Trott knew as much. The said
Deponent further deposeth That John Dan, John Sparks and Joseph Dawson
arrived in Ireland in Captain Everys Sloop in the Company of this
Deponent, which said Sloop departed from Providence about the
beginning of last June, and Hollandsworths Sloop about fourteen dayes
or three weeks before.</p>

upon oath before me Ralph Marshall Esquire, one of his Majesties
Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex and Citty and
Liberty of Westminster, this 25th day of August Anno Domini 1698.</p>

<p>This Informant upon his Oath saith, That about 5 years since he went
aboard the ship <i>Resolution</i>, Captain Robert Glover an Irishman
Commander, (who had 18 Guns and 60 men), to see his Uncle Elisha
Skilling, who was Boatswain of the said Ship but is since Dead, who
detained him in the said Ship together with a French Maletto<a name="FNanchor_2_480" id="FNanchor_2_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_480" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Boy,
which ship sailed from New England in the night to the Isle of May,
where they took in Salt, and thence sailed to Cape Coast in
Guinnea,<a name="FNanchor_3_481" id="FNanchor_3_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_481" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> where a Dutch man of War took 11 men from them, but
returned 9 of them again, keeping the other two as Hostages, in case
they meddled with any Dutchmen. From thence they sailed to Cape Lopaz
and so to Madagascar, where they victualled and cleaned, and thence
sailed into the Red Sea, where they lay waiting for some India ships,
but missing them went to an Island called Succatore<a name="FNanchor_4_482" id="FNanchor_4_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_482" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in the Mouth of
the red Sea, where they bought Provisions and so went to Rajapore,<a name="FNanchor_5_483" id="FNanchor_5_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_483" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
where they took a small Muscat man with 12 Guns laden with Dates and
Rice, in the Harbour; in taking whereof they killed some of her men,
and sent the Muscatt man by Captain Glover (with whom the rest of the
<i>Resolutions</i> Crew had a quarrell)<a name="FNanchor_6_484" id="FNanchor_6_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_484" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to Madagascar, and then chose
one Richard Shivers a Dutchman for their Commander, and then sailed to
Mangelore,<a name="FNanchor_7_485" id="FNanchor_7_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_485" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span> they took a small ship belonging to the Moors,
laden with Rice and Fish, some of which they Plundered and then let
her goe. from thence they went to Callicut,<a name="FNanchor_8_486" id="FNanchor_8_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_486" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> where they took 4 ships
belonging to the Moors at Anchor in the Road, and sent ashore to know
if the Country would Ransome them. But there being a design among the
Countrey people to retake their own ship and the said ship
<i>Resolution</i>, with some Grabbs<a name="FNanchor_9_487" id="FNanchor_9_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_487" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or Boats sent off, They fired two of
the said Prizes and run away and left them. Thence they went to Cape
Comarine, to cruise for Malocca<a name="FNanchor_10_488" id="FNanchor_10_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_488" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> men, but mist them, and took a
Danish ship, out of which they took two men by force and five more
came voluntarily aboard, and left the rest aboard the sloop, having
first taken severall Piggs of Lead, fire arms, and Gun Powder out of
her. from thence they went to the Island Mauretious,<a name="FNanchor_11_489" id="FNanchor_11_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_489" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> where they
took in Provisions and so to St. Marys Island near Madagascar, where
they met with Captain Hoare an Irishman (since Dead) who was commander
of the <i>John and Rebecca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12_490" id="FNanchor_12_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_490" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a Pyrate of about 200 Tuns, 14 Guns,
belonging to the Road Island, who had with her a Prize (a pritty large
ship) belonging to the Mogulls subjects at Suratt, which he had taken
at the Gulph of Persia, laden with Bale Goods. there was there also a
Brigantine belonging to New York, which came to fetch Negroes, and the
hulk of the said ship which Captain Glover carried thither.</p>

<p>The Island St. Maries is a pritty large Island, well inhabited by
black people, where one Captain Baldridge<a name="FNanchor_13_491" id="FNanchor_13_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_491" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> (who, as he was
informed, had formerly killed a man in Jamaica, and thereupon turned
Pirate about 13 years agoe) had built a platforme of a Fort with 22
Guns, which was destroyed, together with Captain Glover and the rest
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span> the Pyrats there, whilst this Informant was at Madagascar about
nine months agoe, by the Blacks, who also killed 7 English men and 4
French men in the house where this Informant was at Madagascar,
sparing only himself.</p>

<p>There was then also a party of English in another part of the Island
of Madagascar, who defended themselves against the Blacks on an Island
in a River there, having some of the blacks on their side, till
Captain Baldredge, who was then absent with the said Brigantine (which
he had bought and sailed in her to Mascarine,<a name="FNanchor_14_492" id="FNanchor_14_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_492" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> an Island belonging
to the French, where he went to sell Prize Goods) returned, and took
them off, carryed them to St. Augustines Bay,<a name="FNanchor_15_493" id="FNanchor_15_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_493" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> they paying
considerably for their Transportation. This Informant further saith
that, before this happened, he run away from the <i>Resolution</i> and
remained on the Island of Madagascar as aforesaid, the said ship being
gone, as he was told, to the Streights of Mallacca, which is about
Tenn months since; That he this Informant was redeemed for a parcell
of Gun Powder by those who defended themselves as aforesaid, and went
with them aboard the Briggantine, who went first to St. Augustines Bay
to putt some men ashore (who had not money to pay for their further
passage) and thence sailed to St. Helena, where they arrived about six
months agoe, pretending there to be a trading ship belonging to New
York, upon which they got water and Provisions.<a name="FNanchor_16_494" id="FNanchor_16_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_494" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But this Informant
run away from the said ship at St. Hellena and concealed himself in
the Island till she was gone (who stayed there about 7 or 8 days) and
continued there about 3 months till the arrivall of the <i>Sampson</i>
there from the East Indies, aboard of which ship he came for England
with the consent of the Governor of St. Helena.</p>

<p>This informant farther saith That he had heard upon Madagascar, That a

belong there was always an outburst of piracy after the conclusion of
a war, because multitudes of privateers found their occupation gone
when peace was proclaimed, and some of them were sure to turn to the
allied trade of piracy. The peace of Ryswyk, between France and Great

<p>Declareth That having lived in Barbadoes and Jamaica and traded in
severall parts of the West Indies, meeting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span> of late with great losses
of above &pound;12,000 sterling by the Earthquake and Enemyes and through
misfortune, came to New York and there finding Captain Kid comeing out
with a full Power to the East Indies to take the Pyrates, which he
shewed me by the means of my Friends, so resolved to go with him to
the East Indies and to remain there at Surrat or any other place where
I could best follow my profession, being a Jeweller, for he told me he
would put into some of the said Parts. Wee sailed from New York the
6th September 1696 in Company with a Brigantine belonging to Bermudas,
bound to the Maderaes. there met with a Brigantine from Barbadoes
bound for England who had lost her Mast and Boltsprit, whom Captain
Kid assisted with a Mast, Riggin and Canvas, for which kindness [the]
Master gave him a few flour Barrells with Sugar. the same Brigantine
after she had what she wanted proceeded on her Voyage. And a day or
two after wee espyed a Ship whom Wee gave chase to three days and came
up with her, found her to be a Portuguez from Brazile bound to the
Maderaes. the Captain of the Portuguez pre[sen]ted Captain Kid with a
Roll of Brazile Tobacco and some Sugar, in lieu of which Captain Kid
sent him a Cheshire Cheese and a Barrell of White Bisket, but through
mistake of the Steward the Barrell thought to be Bisket proved to be
Cutt and Dry Tobacca. So Wee proceeded to Maderaes and saw the
Brigantine in safe that came under our Convoy. wee stayed there one
day. before wee departed from thence the Portuguez ship came in.
Thence wee went to Bona Vista,<a name="FNanchor_2_527" id="FNanchor_2_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_527" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> took in some Salt, thence to St.

names. I was on board the Commodore when he told me that Kids
Commission was firm and good and that he would not molest or hinder
his proceedings for his puting his hands to his Ears, and discoursing
of severall other things of the Voyage amongst the rest the Commodore
told Kid he had lost a great many of his men and asked him to spare
him some, who answered that he would let him have 20 or 30, and about
a day or two after Kid went on board one of the Men of War again and
in the Evening came on board his own ship very much disguised with
drink and left the Men of War without sparing them the men he
promised. Some time after had sight of the Cape, did not put in but
went directly for Madagascar and imported at a place called
Talleer,<a name="FNanchor_6_531" id="FNanchor_6_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_531" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> where took in some Water and provisions. after our being
there some time came a Sail in sight and came to an Anchor in
Augustine Bay, upon which wee weighed Anchor and came to her, the two
Ports being but a little way distant each from other. We found her to
be a Sloop from Barbadoes come to buy Negroes, after which Wee
returned to Talleer, our former Port, and the next day the Master of
the Sloop came on board Us being very ill when he came. a few dayes
after ordered the Sloop to come down to Talleer, and the same day she
came down the Owner and Merchant<a name="FNanchor_7_532" id="FNanchor_7_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_532" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> dyed on board of us, and he that
succeeded him could by no Means agree with the Master of the Sloop but
continually a quarrelling and fighting. Our Captain did what he could
to make up the difference between them but to no purpose. So when wee
had done getting our provisions etc. on board Wee sailed for
Johanna,<a name="FNanchor_8_533" id="FNanchor_8_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_533" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the Sloop followed us, and seeing two Ships gave them
Chase, found them to be both East India Men and so went in together in
Company to Johanna and two India Men came in after.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span> Wee took in Some
Water and went to Mohilla<a name="FNanchor_9_534" id="FNanchor_9_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_534" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to clean our Ship. And this Sloop still
followed Us, but our Captain told him severall times to be gone and
agree amongst themselves, but they took no notice thereof, continuing
with Us all the time of our Stay here, being about 5 weeks, where
buryed severall of our Company but the just number I know not. when
Wee had been there about 5 weeks a Pinnace came on board of Us with
some Men, the quantity I know not, for being mortall sick, the
Merchant of the Sloop dyed there too. Wee returned from this place to
Johanna and the Sloop in our Company. Wee took in some more water and
some French Men, the quantity I know not for I was carryed a shoar
sick and lay a shoar all the time wee lay at Johanna. We sailed
thence, leaving the Sloop behind Us, directly for India and touched at
a place called Motta.<a name="FNanchor_10_535" id="FNanchor_10_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_535" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> there was 5 Junks ashoar and at an Anchor
ditto place. our Captain wanted to take in some water, sending the
Pinnace ashoar for some, which the Natives refused, upon which our
Captain next morning sent both Boats with a matter of 40 Men or
thereabouts with Armes, as I heard lying very Sick of a Feaver, Ague
and Flux, and that he had bought two Cowes and some dates, and 2 dayes
after the People run away into the Mountains, as I heard. after they
run away the People sent a shoar, found India Corn and Garravances<a name="FNanchor_11_536" id="FNanchor_11_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_536" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
in great holes, and brought off likewise six of the Natives, of whom
four leaped overboard in the Night and swam ashoar. the other two gave
[3] Cowes and 2 sheep for their ransom, as I heard of the Seamen,
lying very ill. from thence wee went to the Babs<a name="FNanchor_12_537" id="FNanchor_12_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_537" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and there
anchored to wait for the Pyrates, as the Seamen said, but meeting with

but at Carwar ashoar I heard of the Seamen that they was to go to

came back and gave an account there was 17 Sail, which I heard of the
Seamen as I lay very ill. our Captain ordered two men ashoar on one of
the Babs. when the Fleet came in sight the Men waved the Jack.<a name="FNanchor_14_539" id="FNanchor_14_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_539" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the
whole Fleet came by the Babs on a Saturday in the evening in the month
of August, but the day of the month I do not remember. our Captain
weighed and stood amongst the Fleet, as I heard of the Seamen. the
next morning at break of day one of the Fleet began to fire at Us, as
I heard of the Seamen, which alarming the rest they all did the same.
there was one Ship which the Captain said was a Mallabar, pretty near
Us, as I heard of the Seamen. then our Captain ordered the People to
row up to him, being but little Wind, then the Mallabar fired at Us
and our Captain at him severall Guns. at last our Captain perceiving
an English and Dutch Colours did all he could to get away. the Captain
designed to go to the high Land off St. Johns.<a name="FNanchor_15_540" id="FNanchor_15_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_540" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> meeting with a
small Vessell under English Colours he chased her and comanded the
Master to come on board and plundered the Ship. I hearing a great
noise asked what it was. they told me that our Folks beat the People
aboard of the little ship and against night I heard there was a
Portuguez. so doing my endeavour to creep up to speak to the Portuguez
and asked him what was the best news, he told me that he and the
Master was forced to stay on board of our Ship, and that he did belong
to Bombay, and that our Captain had taken out some Rice, Raisons and
old Cloths and some Money. I heard of the Seamen that our Captain had
Information of three ships that had gone out of Aden bound for
Callicut being off Carwar, and being in necessity for Wood and Water
put in there, at which time I made great intercession to the Captain
for leave to go ashoar, which at last I obtained by giving him a
Beaver Hat, for he was unwilling to let any go ashoar but whom he
thought he could trust, for fear they should run away for most of his
people seemed dissatisfyed and would I believe do as I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span> done in
making their Escape if had opportunity, for the Carpenter and his mate
with severall others does design to run away with the Pinnace. This I
do swear by the old Testament to the best of my knowledge and what I
have heard of the Seamen that all the above written is true.</p>

Kidd, the most famous pirate in American history, was a Scot, born in
Dundee in 1654. In 1689-1690, in command of a captured ship, he took a
creditable part in the attacks on Mariegalante and St. Martin's by
Captain Hewetson, who at Kidd's trial testified to his bravery; but a
few weeks later his men, ex-pirates apparently, ran away with his
ship. <i>Cal. St. P. Col.</i>, 1689-1692, pp. 122, 226, 227; Hargrave,
<i>State Trials</i>, V. 326. In 1689 he settled in New York, where he seems
to have been well regarded; in the record of his marriage license, May
16, 1691 (<i>N.E. Hist. Gen. Reg.</i>, VI. 63) he is styled "William Kidd,
Gentleman," and two days earlier the New York assembly (<i>Journal</i>, ed.
1764, I. 6, 13) voted him a gratuity of &pound;150 for services in
connection with the arrival of Governor Sloughter. In 1695, Kidd being
then in England, Robert Livingston of New York arranged in London with
Lord Bellomont, who had been designated but not yet commissioned as a
governor in America, and with others, for a privateering voyage under
Kidd's command. Other sharetakers were Sir Edward Russell, first lord
of the admiralty, Sir John Somers, lord keeper of the great seal, the
Duke of Shrewsbury, secretary of state, and the Earl of Romney,
master-general of the ordnance; and the king himself was to receive
one-tenth of the profits of the cruise. Kidd's letter of marque, dated
Dec. 11, 1695, is in Hargrave's <i>State Trials</i>, V. 307. To it was
added, Jan. 26, 1696, <i>ibid.</i>, 308, a commission to apprehend pirates.
Kidd sailed from England in April, 1696, in the <i>Adventure Galley</i>,
287 tons, 34 guns, 70 men. At New York he increased his crew to 155
men (there is a list of them in <i>Cal. St. Pap. Col.</i>, 1700, p. 199),
and sailed thence in September for Madagascar and the East Indies.
Whether it was by his fault that the <i>Adventure Galley</i> slipped from
privateering and the search for pirates into acts of piracy, or
whether, as Kidd alleged, his men forced his hand, has been doubted,
but it is probable that he shared the guilt. In the summer of 1698
complaints began to come in from India and from the East India
Company, and in November, 1698, orders were sent to the governors of
colonies in America to apprehend Kidd as a pirate whenever he should
appear. The ensuing papers, especially his own narrative and
Bellomont's letters, tell the story of his arrival and arrest. As
under Massachusetts law he could not be condemned to death for piracy,
he was, probably illegally, carried to England in the spring of 1700,
and there tried at the Old Bailey for the murder of one of his men and
for piracy. After an unfair trial and on insufficient evidence, he was
condemned, and was hanged at Execution Dock May 23, 1701.
</p><p>
As to Benjamin Franks, we learn from a deposition of William Cuthbert
(<i>Journal of the House of Commons</i>, XIII. 26) that two of Kidd's men
deserted him at Carwar because of his attempts and designs toward
piracy and his cruel conduct toward his men; Franks, Hebrew jeweller
of New York, was apparently one of the two. Apparently he was a Danish
subject; Westergaard, <i>Danish West Indies</i>, p. 110.</p></div>

<p>Maryland <span xml:lang="la">scilicet</span></p>

<p>Came Theophilus Turner, Borne at Heckfield near Hartley roade in
Hampshire, Aged about thirty years, and being sworne upon the Holy
Evangelists to declare the truth of what he knows concerning any Acts
of Pyracy comitted by him or any others, saith:</p>

<p>That he sayled out of London about three years agoe in the Ship
<i>Hanniball</i>, Captain William Hill Commander, which ship was a Merchant
ship mounted with thirty two Gunns and Navigated with seventy Men, and
went upon the Coast of Guinea, where the Captain put his Men to very
short allowance so that severall of them, vizt. Henry Webber, 3d Mate,
who afterwards Comanded the said ship, and severall others, took the
ship from him and went to Brasile, where the Deponent and some others
left the ship. After that the Deponent had lived at Brasile about one
yeare, a French Vessell which had lost her top mast arrived there
under the Comand of Mounsieur de Ley, on Board of which Vessell the
deponent embarqued himselfe for the Coast of India, the said De Ley
being bound to Bengall, in the Voyage whereto they touched at the
Island of Johannah, an Island [whose] inhabitants are Arabians, which
was in the Month of May or June 1698: and riding there at Anchor with
the said ship, came a ship of fourty Gunns called the <i>Resolution</i> by
the Men on Board, But understood her right name was the <i>Moco</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_560" id="FNanchor_2_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_560" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
from Madagaskar, Navi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>gated with about 130 or 140 Men under the Comand
of Captain Robert Culliford. De Ley weighed one Anchor and cut the
other Cable, but Culliford chasing him took him and brought the
deponent on Board them, being the only Englishman on board De Ley, and
examined him concerning Deleys Loading, with many threats. after they
plundered the ship and found there 2000 l. in money, besides Wine and
Cloath, which they took, and because the Deponent was an Englishman
they would not let him go on board De Ley again but kept him. After
which the said Culliford sayled with the said ship upon the Coast of
India: and about the middle of August came up with a Pyrate, who came
out of America some where near Rhroad Island under the Comand of
Richard Chivers, had 80 or 90 men and twelve Gunns, who kept Company
and Consorted with Culliford. And about the End of September last they
met off of Suratt with a turkey ship belonging to Suratt, which
Chivers crew boarded: and the Quartermaster and some of Cullifords
crew went on Board: she was laden with Pieces 8, Gold and Dollers, was
reputed to the vallue of one Hundred and twenty or thirty thousand
pounds. there were some shots made and several turks were killed and
wounded and two or three of Chivers Company: they put the men on
shoare on the Coast of India, sunck their own ship and took the turkey
ship and then shared the money, about 700 or 800 l. a man in each
ship, and gave the Deponent who pumped for them on occasion and was
ready at call 250 l., not deeming him as one of them but in the nature
of a prisoner, and told him if that he would go out with them their
next Voyage, he should be all one as the rest. thence the said
Culliford and Chivers sayled to Madagascoe, Port St. Marys, a large
Island about three or four Hundred Leagues in Length inhabited by a
numerous people being Negroes.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, June the 19th, 1699.</p>

<p>The Memorial of Duncan Campbell, of Boston, humbly presented to his
Excellency the Earle of Bellomont.</p>

<p>I, the said Duncan Campbell, being at Rhode-Island on Saturday the
17th of June currant, that morning I went in a Sloop from said Island,
in Company with Mr. James Emott of New-Yorke,<a name="FNanchor_2_562" id="FNanchor_2_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_562" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and two other men
belonging to said Sloop, towards Block-Island, and, about three
leagues from that Island, I mett a Sloop commanded by Captain Kidd,
and haveing on board about Sixteen men besides; after hailing of which
Sloop and being informed that the said Kidd was Commander thereof, he
said Kidd desired me to come on board the same; which I accordingly
did, and after some discourse passed, said Kidd desired me to do him
the favour as to make what Speed I could for Boston and acquaint your
Excellency that the said Kidd had brought a Ship, about five or six
hundred Tuns, from Madagascar, which, some considerable time since, he
met with in [<i>blank</i>] and commanded her there to bring to; and that
thereupon the Pilott, being a French man, came on board the said Kidds
Ship, and told him, said Kidd, he was welcome, and that the said Ship
(to which said Pilott belonged) was a lawfull Prize to him the said
Kidd, she sailing under a French Pass: Whereupon he, the said Kidd,
and Com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>pany, took the said Ship, and afterwards, understanding that
the same belonged to the Moors, he, said Kidd, would have delivered
her up again, but his men violently fell upon him, and thrust him into
his Cabbin, saying the said Ship was a fair Prize, and then carryed
her into Madigascar and rifled her of what they pleased, but before
they got into Madigascar, the Gally under Command of him, said Kidd,
became so leaky that she would scarce keep above water, whereupon the
Company belonging thereto, haveing taken out of her her Guns and some
other Things and put them on board the Prize, sett the said Gally on
fire. The said Captain Kidd further told me that, when he and his
Company were arrived at Madagascar, several of his Company moved him
to go and take a Ship called the <i>Moco</i> Frigat, that lay ready fitted
at a place not far distant from them, in the possession of certain
Privateers, and to go in the same for the red-Sea. But that he the
said Kidd said that if they would join with him he would attempt the
taking of the said Ship, (supposeing her a lawful Prize, being
formerly belonging to the King of England), but would not afterwards
go with them on the said design to the red-Sea. Whereupon ninety of
his the said Kidd's men deserted him, went and tooke the said Ship,
and sailed with the same on the aforesaid design, as he, said Kidd,
was informed; obliging one Captain Culliver, the then Commander of
her, to go along with them.</p>

<p>And the said Kidd further told me That, his men having left him and
his design frustrated, he thought it his best way to preserve the said
Ship then in his possession, and the goods on board her, for his
Imployers or the proper Owners thereof: And accordingly, with the few
men he had then left, which would not joine with the other Ninety in
their aforesaid design (being about Twenty in Number) and with a few
other men that he procured at Madagascar to assist him in navigating
said Ship, he intended to have brought the same to Boston, according
to his Orders; but touching in his way at the Island of St. Thomas's
and other places in the West-Indies, he there heard that great
Complaints were preferred against him, and he proclaimed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span> Pirate,
which occasioned him to saile to a place called Mona, near
Hispaniola;<a name="FNanchor_3_563" id="FNanchor_3_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_563" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> from whence he sent to Curaso,<a name="FNanchor_4_564" id="FNanchor_4_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_564" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and bought there the
Sloop on which he is now on board, and tooke into her out of the said
ship to the Value of about eight or ten thousand pounds in goods,
gold, and Plate, for which Gold and Plate he traded at Madagascar, and
was produced by the sale of sundry goods and Stores that he tooke out
of the <i>Adventure Gally</i>, formerly commanded by him, and hath left the
Ship taken by his Company, and carryed to Madagascar as aforesaid, at
or near Mona abovesaid, in the Custody of about six men of his owne
Company and Eighteen others that he got from Curaso (the Merchant of
whom he bought the said Sloop being intrusted therewith), unto which
he hath promised to returne again in three months, the said Kidd
resolveing to come into Boston or New-Yorke to deliver up unto your
Excellency what goods and Treasure he hath on board, and to pray your
Excellency's assistance to enable him to bring the said Ship, left by
him at Mona aforesaid, from thence, the said Ship being disabled from
comeing, for want of furniture.<a name="FNanchor_5_565" id="FNanchor_5_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_565" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But the said Captain Kidd further informed me, That by reason of what
his Men had heard in the West-Indies, as aforesaid, of their being
proclaimed Pirates, they would not consent to his coming into any Port
without some Assurance from your Excellency That they should not be
imprisoned or molested. And the said Captain Kidd did several times
protest solemnly that he had not done anything since his going out in
the said Gally contrary to his Commission and Orders, more than what
he was necessitated unto by being overpowered by his Men, that
deserted him, as aforesaid, who evil intreated him several times for
his not consenting to, or joineing with them in, their actions. And
all the men on board the Sloop now with him did in like manner
solemnly protest their innocence, and declared that they had used
their utmost endeavours in preserving the aforesaid Ship and goods for
the Owners or Imployers. Said Kidd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span> also said, that if your Lordship
should see Cause so to direct, he would carry the said Ship for
England, there to render an Account of his Proceedings.</p>

his Men related to</p>

<p>A Narrative of the Voyage of Captain William Kidd, Commander of the
<i>Adventure Gally</i>, from London to the East Indies.</p>

<p>That the Journal of the said Captain Kidd being violently taken from
him in the Port of St. Marie's in Madagascar, and his life many times
being threatned to be taken away from him by 97 of his men that
deserted him there, he cannot give that exact Account he otherwise
could have done, but as far as his memory will serve is as followeth;
viz.</p>

<p>That the said <i>Adventure Gally</i> was launched in Castle's Yard at
Deptford<a name="FNanchor_2_567" id="FNanchor_2_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_567" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> about the 4th day of December 1695, and about the latter
end of February the said Gally came to the buoy in the Nore, and about
the first Day of March following, his men were pressed from him for
the Fleet, which caused him to stay there 19 Days,<a name="FNanchor_3_568" id="FNanchor_3_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_568" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and then sailed
for the Downs, and arrived there about the 8th or 10th Day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span> of April
1696; and sailed thence for Plymouth, and on the 23d Day of the said
month of April he sailed from Plymouth on his intended Voyage, and
some time in the month of May met with a small French Vessel with Salt
and Fishing Tackle on board, bound for Newfoundland, which he took and
made Prize of and carried the same into New-York, about the 4th day of
July, where she was condemned as lawful Prize, the produce whereof
purchased Provisions for the said Gally for her further intended
Voyage.</p>

<p>That, about the 6th day of September 1696 the said Captain Kidd sailed
for the Maderas in Company with one Joyner, Master of a Briganteen
belonging to Bermudas, and arrived there about the 8th day of October
following; and thence to Bonavista,[4] where they arrived about the
19th of said month, and took in some Salt and stayed three or four
days, and sailed thence to St. Jago,<a name="FNanchor_4_569" id="FNanchor_4_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_569" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and arrived there the 24th of
the said month, where he took in some Water and staied about 8 or 9
Days, and thence sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, and in the Latitude
of 32, on the 12th day of December 1696 met with four English Men of
War, whereof Captain Warren was Commodore, and sailed a week in their
Company, and then parted and sailed to Telere, a Port in the Island of
Madagascar, and being there about the 29th day of January, came in a
Sloop belonging to Barbadoes, loaded with Rhum, Sugar, Powder and
Shot, one &mdash;&mdash; French Master, and Mr. Hatton and Mr. John Batt
Merchants, and the said Hatton came on board the said Gally and was
suddenly taken ill there and dyed in the Cabin: and about the latter
end of February sayled for the Island of Johanna, the said Sloop
keeping Company, and arrived there about the 18th day of March, where
he found Four East India Merchantmen, outward bound, and watered there
all together, and stayd about four days, And from thence about the 22d
of March sayled for Mehila, an Island Ten Leagues distant from
Johanna, where he arrived the next morning, and there careened the
said Gally, and about fifty men died there in a weekes time.</p>

<p>That on the 25th day of April 1697 set saile for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span> Coast of India,
and came upon the Coast of Mallabar in the beginning of the month of
September, and went into Carrwarr upon that Coast about the middle of
the same month and watered there, and the Gentlemen of the English
Factory gave the Narrator an Account that the Portugese were fitting
out two men of War to take him, and advised him to set out to Sea, and
to take care of himselfe from them, and immediately he set sail
thereupon ... about the 22d of the said month of September, and the
next morning about break of day saw the said two Men of War standing
for the said Gally, and spoke with him, and asked him Whence he was,
who replyed, from London, and they returned answer, from Goa, and so
parted, wishing each other a good Voyage, and making still along the
Coast, the Commodore of the said Men of War kept dogging the said
Gally all Night, waiting an Opportunity to board the same, and in the
morning, without speaking a word, fired 6 great Guns at the Gally,
some whereof went through her, and wounded four of his Men, and
thereupon he fired upon him again, and the Fight continued all day,
and the Narrator had eleven men wounded: The other Portuguese Men of
War lay some distance off, and could not come up with the Gally, being
calm, else would have likewise assaulted the same. The said Fight was
sharp, and the said Portuguese left the said Gally with such
Satisfaction that the Narrator believes no Portuguese will ever attack
the Kings Colours again, in that part of the World especially, and
afterwards continued upon the said Coast, cruising upon the Cape of
Cameroone<a name="FNanchor_5_570" id="FNanchor_5_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_570" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> for Pyrates that frequent that Coast, till the beginning
of the month of November 1697 when he met with Captain How in the
<i>Loyal Captaine</i>, an English Ship belonging to Maddarass,<a name="FNanchor_6_571" id="FNanchor_6_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_571" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> bound to
Surat, whom he examined and, finding his Pass good, designed freely to
let her pass about her affairs; but having two Dutchmen on board, they
told the Narrator's men that they had divers Greeks and Armenians on
board, who had divers precious Stones and other rich Goods on board,
which caused his men to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span> be very mutinous, and got up their Armes, and
swore they would take the Ship, and two-thirds of his Men voted for
the same. The narrator told them The small Armes belonged to the
Gally, and that he was not come to take any Englishmen or lawful
Traders, and that if they attempted any such thing they should never
come on board the Gally again, nor have the Boat, or Small-Armes, for
he had no Commission to take any but the King's Enemies, and Pirates,
and that he would attack them with the Gally and drive them into
Bombay; the other being a Merchantman and having no Guns, might easily
have done it with a few hands, and with all the arguments and menaces
he could use could scarce restraine them from their unlawful Designe,
but at last prevailed, and with much ado got him cleare, and let him
go about his business. All which Captain How will attest, if living.</p>

<p>And that about the 18th or 19th day of the said month of November met
with a Moors Ship of about 200 Tuns,<a name="FNanchor_7_572" id="FNanchor_7_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_572" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> coming from Suratt, bound to
the Coast of Mallabar, loaded with two horses, Sugar and Cotton, to
trade there, having about 40 Moors on board, with a Dutch Pylot,
Boatswain and Gunner, which said Ship the Narrator hailed, and
commanded on board, and with him came 8 or 9 Moors and the said three
Dutchmen, who declared it was a Moors Ship, and demanding their Pass
from Suratt, which they shewed, and the same was a French Pass, which
he believes was shewed by a Mistake, for the Pylot swore Sacrament<a name="FNanchor_8_573" id="FNanchor_8_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_573" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
she was a Prize, and staid on board the Gally and would not return
again on board the Moors Ship, but went in the Gally to the Port of
St. Maries.</p>

<p>And that about the First Day of February following, upon the same
Coast, under French Colours with a Designe to decoy, met with a
Bengall Merchantman belonging to Surrat of the burthen of 4 or 500
Tuns, 10 guns, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span> commanded the Master on board, and a Frenchman,
Inhabitant of Suratt and belonging to the French Factory there, and
Gunner of said Ship, came on board as Master, and when he came on
board the Narrator caused the English Colours to be hoisted, and the
said Master was surprized and said, You are all English; and asking,
Which was the Captain, whom when he saw, said, Here is a good Prize,
and delivered him the French Pass.<a name="FNanchor_9_574" id="FNanchor_9_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_574" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And that with the said two
Prizes sailed for the Port of St. Maries, in Madagascar; and sailing
thither the said Gally was so leaky that they feared she would have
sunk every hour, and it required eight men, every two Glasses<a name="FNanchor_10_575" id="FNanchor_10_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_575" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to
keep her free, and was forced to woold<a name="FNanchor_11_576" id="FNanchor_11_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_576" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> her round with Cables to
keep her together, and with much ado carried her into the said Port of
St. Maries, where they arrived about the First Day of April 1698, and
about the 6th day of May the lesser Prize was haled into the Careening
Island or Key, the other not being arrived, and ransacked and sunk by
the mutinous men, who threatened the Narrator and the men that would
not join with them, to burn and sink the other, that they might not go
home and tell the news.</p>

<p>And that when he arrived in the said Port there was a Pyrate Ship,
called the <i>Moca</i> Frigat,<a name="FNanchor_12_577" id="FNanchor_12_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_577" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> at an Anchor, Robert Culliford Commander
thereof, who with his men left the same at his coming in, and ran into
the Woods, And the Narrator proposed to his Men to take the same,
having sufficient power and authority so to do,<a name="FNanchor_13_578" id="FNanchor_13_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_578" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but the mutinous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Crew told him, if he offered the same, they would rather fire two Guns
into him than one into the other, and thereupon 97 deserted, and went
into the <i>Moca</i> Frigat, and sent into the Woods for the said Pyrates
and brought the said Culliford and his men on board again; and all the
time she staid in the said Port, which was for the Space of 4 or 5
Dayes, the said Deserters, sometimes in great numbers, came on board
the said Gally and <i>Adventure Prize</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_579" id="FNanchor_14_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_579" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and carried away great guns,
Powder, Shot, small Armes, Sailes, Anchors, Cables, Chirurgeons Chest,
and what else they pleased, and threatned several times to murder the
Narrator (as he was informed, and advised to take care of himselfe)
which they designed in the Night to effect but was prevented by his
locking himself in his Cabin at night, and securing himselfe with
barrocading the same with bales of Goods, and having about 40 small
Armes, besides Pistols, ready charged, kept them out. Their wickedness
was so great, after they had plundered and ransacked sufficiently,
went four miles off to one Edward Welche's house,<a name="FNanchor_15_580" id="FNanchor_15_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_580" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> where his the
Narrator's Chest was lodged, and broke it open, and took out 10 Ounces
of Gold, forty Pounds of Plate, 370 pieces of Eight, the Narrator's
Journal, and a great many papers that belonged to him and the People
of New-York that fitted them out.</p>

<p>That about the 15th of June, the <i>Moca</i> Frigat went away, being manned
with about 130 Men and forty Guns, bound out to take all Nations. Then
it was that the Narrator was left only with 13 Men, so that the Moors
he had to pump and keep the <i>Adventure Gally</i> above Water being
carried away, she sunk in the harbour, and the Narrator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span> with the said
thirteen men went on board of the <i>Adventure-Prize</i>, where he was
forced to stay five months for a fair Wind. In the meantime some
Passengers presented, that were bound for these Parts, which he tooke
on board to help to bring the said <i>Adventure-Prize</i> home.</p>

<p>That about the beginning of April 1699 the Narrator arrived at
Anguilla in the West-Indies and sent his Boat on Shore, where his men
had the News That he and his People were proclaimed Pirates, which put
them into such a Consternation that they sought all Opportunitys to
run the Ship on shore upon some reef or Shoal, fearing the Narrator
should carry them into some English Port.</p>

<p>From Anguilla they came to St. Thomas, where his Brother-in-law Samuel
Bradley<a name="FNanchor_16_581" id="FNanchor_16_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_581" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was put on shore, being sick, and five more went away and
deserted him, where he heard the same News, that the Narrator and his
Company were proclaimed Pirates, which incensed the People more and
more. From St. Thomas set saile for Moona, an Island between
Hispaniola and Porto Rico, where they met with a Sloop called the <i>St.
Anthony</i>, bound for Montego<a name="FNanchor_17_582" id="FNanchor_17_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_582" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> from Curaso, Mr. William Bolton<a name="FNanchor_18_583" id="FNanchor_18_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_583" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Merchant and Samuel Wood Master. The men on board then swore they
would bring the Ship no further. The Narrator then sent the said Sloop
<i>St. Anthony</i> for Curaso for Canvas to make Sails for the Prize, she
being not able to proceed, and she returned in 10 Dayes, and after the
Canvas came he could not persuade the men to carry her for
New-England, but Six of them went and carried their Chests and things
on board of two Dutch Sloops, bound for Curaso, and would not so much
as heele the Vessel or do any-thing; the remainder of the men not
being able to bring the <i>Adventure-Prize</i> to Bos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>ton, the Narrator
secured her in a good safe Harbour in some Part of Hispaniola, and
left her in the Possession of Mr. Henry Boulton of Antego, Merchant,
the Master, three of the old men, and 15 or 16 of the men that
belonged to the said Sloop <i>St. Anthony</i> and a Briganteen belonging to
one Burt of Curaso.</p>

<p>That the Narrator bought the said Sloop <i>St. Anthony</i> of Mr. Bolton,
for the Owners accompt, and after he had given Directions to the said
Bolton to be careful of the Ship and Ladeing and persuaded him to stay
three months till he returned, and then made the best of his way to
New-York, where he heard the Earl of Bellomont was, who was
principally concerned in the <i>Adventure Gally</i>, and hearing his
Lordship was at Boston, came thither and has now been 45 Dayes from
the said Ship.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Wm. Kidd.</span></p>

<p>Boston, 7th July 1699.</p>

<p>Further the Narrator saith, That the said Ship was left at St.
Katharina on the Southeast part of Hispaniola, about three Leagues to
Leward of the Westerly end of Savano.<a name="FNanchor_19_584" id="FNanchor_19_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_584" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Whilst he lay at Hispaniola

Pieces of Eight, whereof he received the Sloop <i>Antonio</i> at 3000
Pieces of 8/8, and four thousand two hundred Pieces of 8/8 by Bills of
Exchange, drawn by Bolton and Burt upon Messieurs Gabril and
Lemont,<a name="FNanchor_21_586" id="FNanchor_21_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_586" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Merchants in Curracao, made payable to Mr. Burt, who went
himself to Curracao, and the Value of four thousand Pieces of 8/8 more
in Dust and barr-gold, which Gold, with some more traded for at
Madagascar, being Fifty Pound Weight or upwards in Quantity, the
Narrator left in Custody of Mr. &mdash;&mdash; Gardner of Gardner's-Island,<a name="FNanchor_22_587" id="FNanchor_22_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_587" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>

corded about, and sealed. Saith, He took no receipt for it of Mr.
Gardner.</p>

<p>The Gold that was seized at Mr. Campbel's the Narrator traded for at
Madagascar, with what came out of the Gally.</p>

<p>Saith, That he carried in the <i>Adventure Gally</i> from New-York, 154
Men; Seventy whereof came out of England with him. Some of his Sloop's
Company put two Bailes of Goods on shore at Gardner's-Island, being
their own proper. The Narrator delivered a Chest of Goods, <i>viz.</i>
Muslins, Latches, Romals<a name="FNanchor_23_588" id="FNanchor_23_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_588" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and flowered Silke, unto Mr. Gardner of
Gardner's-Island aforesaid, to be kept there for the Narrator. put no
Goods on shore any-where else. Several of his Company landed their
Chests and other Goods at several places.</p>

<p>Further saith, He delivered a small Bayle of course Callicoes unto a
Sloop-Man of Rhode-Island that he had emploied there. The Gold seized
at Mr. Campbell's the Narrator intended for Presents to some that he
expected to do him Kindness. Some of his Company put their Chests and
Bailes on board a New Yorke Sloop lying at Gardner's-Island.</p>

as they call it, (it is made of Water, and Limes, and Sugar) and there
they drank to one another; and, says Capt. Kidd, Before I would do you

Damnation to himself several times, if he did. And he took the Cup,

<p>It will not be unwellcome News to your Lordships to tell you that I
secured Captain Kidd last Thursday in the Gaol of this Town with five
or six of his men. He had been hovering on the Coast towards New-York
for more than a fortnight, and sent to one Mr. Emot to come from
New-York to him at a place called Oyster-Bay in Nassau Island<a name="FNanchor_2_591" id="FNanchor_2_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_591" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> not
far from New-York. He brought Emot from thence to Rhoad Island and
there landed him, sending him hither to me with an Offer of his
comeing into this port provided I would pardon him. I was a litle
pussiled how to manage a treaty of that kind with Emot, a cunning
Jacobite, a fast Friend of Fletcher's and my avowed enimie. When he
proposed my pardoning Kid, I told him It was true the King had allowed
me a power to pardon Pyrates; But that I was so tender of useing it
(because I would bring no Staine on my Reputation), that I had set
myselfe a Rule never to pardon Pyracy without the King's expresse
leave and Command. Emot told me that Kid had left the great Moorish
Ship he took in India (which Ship I have since found went by the Name
of the <i>Quidah-Marchant</i>), in a Creek on the Coast of Hispaniola, with
Goods to the Value of thirty Thousand pounds: That he had bought a
Sloop, in which he was come before to make his termes: that he had
brought in the Sloop with him severall Bailes of East India goods,
threescore pound weight of gold in Dust and in Ingotts, about a
hundred weight of Silver and several other things which he beleived
would sell for about Ten Thousand pounds. Emot also told me that Kid
was very innocent and would make it appear that his men forced him,
locking him up in the Cabin of the <i>Adventure Galley</i> while they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
robbed two or three Ships, and he could prove this by many witnesses.
I answered Emot that if Kid could make that appear he might safely
come into this Port and I would undertake to get him the King's
Pardon. I writ a Letter to Captain Kid inviteing him to come in,<a name="FNanchor_3_592" id="FNanchor_3_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_592" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and that I would procure a pardon for him, provided he were as
innocent as Mr. Emot said he was. I sent my letter to him by one Mr.
Campbell of this Town, and a Scotch as well as Kid, and his
Acquaintance: within three or four days Campbell returned to me with a
Letter from Kid, full of protestations of his Innocence, and informing
me of his Design of coming with his Sloop into this Port. I must not
forget to tell your Lordships that Campbell brought three or four
small Jewells to my Wife, which I was to know nothing of; but she came
quickly and discovered them to me and asked me whither she should keep
them, which I advised her to do for the present. For I reflected that
my shewing an over-nicety might do hurt, before I had made a full
discovery what goods and treasure were in the Sloop. All this whole
matter, even to my writing my Letter to Kid, was transacted with the
privity and advice of the Councill.</p>

<p>Kid landed here this day Seven night; and I would not so much as speak
with him but before Witnesses: I thought he looked very guilty, and to
make me believe so he and his friend Livingston<a name="FNanchor_4_593" id="FNanchor_4_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_593" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (who posted hither
from Albany, upon newes of Captain Kid's designe of comeing hither),
and Campbell aforesaid began to juggle together and Imbezle some of
the Cargo; besides, Kid did strangely trifle with me and the Councill
three or four times that we had him under Examination. Mr. Livingston
also came to me in a peremptory manner and demanded up his Bond and
the articles which he sealed to me upon Kid's Expedition, and told me
that Kid swore all the Oaths in the World that unless I did
immediately indemnifie Mr. Livingston by giving up his Securities he
would never bring in that great Ship and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span> Cargo, but that he would
take care to satisfie Mr. Livingston himself out of that Cargo. I
thought this was such an Impertinence, in both Kid and Livingston,
that it was time for me to look about me, and to secure Kid. I had
notice that he designed my wife a Thousand Pound in Gold Dust and
Ingotts last Thursday, but I spoyled his Complement by ordering him to
be arrested and committed that Day, showing the Councill my orders
from Court for that purpose. Two Gentlemen of the Councill, Two
Merchants, and the Collector, have the Charge of all the Cargo, and
they are preparing Inventories of every thing, which shall be sent to
your Lordships by the next Ship.<a name="FNanchor_5_594" id="FNanchor_5_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_594" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I delivered up to those five
persons the Jewells that I have formerly told you Kid sent by Campbell
to my Wife, and that at the Councill Board.</p>

<p>If I had kept Mr. Secretary Vernon's Orders for seizing and securing
Kid and his associates with all their Effects with less Secrecy, I had
never got him to come in: for his Country men, Mr. Graham<a name="FNanchor_6_595" id="FNanchor_6_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_595" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
Livingston, would have been sure to caution him to shift for him selfe
and would have been well paid for their pains. I received the Lords
Justices<a name="FNanchor_7_596" id="FNanchor_7_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_596" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Orders about Kid, and likewise Mr. Secretary Vernon's,
about three moneths before my leaveing New-York, but I never
discovered them to any body, and when I heard people say, that the
neighbouring Governors had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span> Orders from Court to seize him, I laughed,
as if I believed noe such thing. I wish they may not let him escape
here, as they have Bradish, a notorious Pyrate. About a fortnight ago,
Bradish and another Pyrate got out of the Gaol of this Town and
escaped with the Consent of the Gaoler as there is great reason to
beleive.<a name="FNanchor_8_597" id="FNanchor_8_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_597" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>As the Law stands in this Country a Pyrate cannot be punished with
Death; therefore I desire to receive orders what to do with Bradish's
Crew, and also with Kid, and those Men of his I have taken.<a name="FNanchor_9_598" id="FNanchor_9_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_598" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Since my leaving New-York one of the four Ships has come in that went
from thence to Madagascar last Summer and of which I informed your
Lordships, and has brought Sixty Pyrates and a vast deall of Treasure.
I hear that every one of the Pyrates paid 150 l. for his passage, and
the owners, I am told, have cleared thirty Thousand pounds by this
Voyage. It is observable that Mr. Hackshaw, one of the Merchants that
petitioned against me to your Lordships, and Stephen Delancy, a hot
headed saucy Frenchman and Mr. Hackshaw's Correspondent, are the
cheife owners of this Ship. I hear there were 200 Pyrates at
Madagascar when this Ship came away, who intended to take their

of a man of War. I am manning out a Ship to go in Quest of the

New York Apr. 2, 1698, and first came to Boston May 26, 1699. The part
he had taken in sending out Kidd to capture pirates made Kidd's piracy
a matter of special indignation and embarrassment to him, particularly
when the affair was used in Parliament, in the session of 1700, as a
means of attack on the Lord Chancellor Somers (see <a href="#DOC_71">doc. no. 71</a>,

<p>The Narrative of John Gardner of Gardners-Island, alias Isle of Wight,
relating to Captain William Kidd.</p>

<p>That about twenty dayes agoe, Mr. Emot of New Yorke came to the
Narrators House, and desired a boat to go for New Yorke, telling the
Narrator he came from my Lord at Boston. Whereupon the Narrator
furnished the said Emot with a boat, and he went for New Yorke, and
that Evening the Narrator saw a Sloop with Six Guns rideing at an
Anchor off Gardners Island. and two days afterwards in the Evening the
Narrator went aboard said Sloop to enquire what she was, and so soon
as he came on board Captain Kidd (then unknown to the Narrator) asked
him how himselfe and Family did, telling him that he the said Kidd was
going to my Lord at Boston, and desired the Narrator to carry three
Negroes, two boys and a girle, ashore, to keep till he the said Kidd
or his Order should call for them, which the Narrator accordingly did.
That about two hours after the Narrator had got the said Negroes
ashore, Captain Kidd sent his boat ashore with two bailes of Goods and
a Negro Boy, and the morning after, said Kidd desired the Narrator to
come immediately on board and bring Six Sheep with him for his the
said Kidds Voyage for Boston, which the Narrator did, when Kidd asked
him to spare a barrel of Cyder, which the Narrator with great
importunity consented to, and sent two of his men for it, who brought
the Cyder on board said Sloop, but whilst the men were gone for the
Cyder, Captain Kidd offered the Narrator several Pieces of
damnified<a name="FNanchor_2_604" id="FNanchor_2_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_604" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Muslin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span> Bengalls as a Present to his Wife, which the
said Kidd put in a bagg, and gave the Narrator, and about a Quarter of
an Hour afterwards the said Kidd tooke up two or three pieces of
damnified Muslin and gave the Narrator for his proper Use. And the
Narrators men then coming on board with the said Barrel of Cyder as
aforesaid, the said Kidd gave them four pieces of Arabian Gold for
their trouble and also for bringing him Wood. Then the said Kidd,
ready to saile, told this Narrator he would pay him for the Cyder, to
which the Narrator answered That he was already satisfied for it by
the Present made to his Wife. And this Narrator observed that some of
Kidds men gave to the Narrators men some inconsiderable things of
small value, which this Narrator believes were Muslins for Neckcloths.
And then the Narrator took leave of the said Kidd and went ashore, and
at parting the said Kidd fired four Guns and stood for Block-Island.</p>

<p>About three Dayes afterwards the said Kidd sent the Master of the
Sloop and one Clarke in his boat for the Narrator, who went on board
with them, And the said Kidd desired this Narrator to take on shore
with him and keep for him, the said Kidd, and Order, a Chest, and a
box of gold and a bundle of Quilts and Four Bayles of Goods, which box
of gold the said Kidd told the Narrator was intended for my Lord; and
the Narrator complied with the said Kidds request and took on shore
the said Chest, box of gold, Quilts, and bayles of Goods.</p>

<p>And the Narrator further saith That two of Kidds Crew, who went by the
Names of Cooke and Parrat,<a name="FNanchor_3_605" id="FNanchor_3_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_605" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> delivered to him, the Narrator, two
baggs of Silver, which they told the Narrator weighed thirty pound
weight, for which he gave receipt. And That another of Kidd's men
delivered to the Narrator a small bundle of gold, and gold dust of
about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span> a pound weight, to keep for him, and did also present the
Narrator with a Sash and a pair of worsted Stockins. And just before
the Sloop sayled Captain Kidd presented the Narrator with a bagg of
Sugar, and then tooke leave and sayled for Boston.</p>

<p>And the Narrator further saith, he knew nothing of Kidds being
proclaimed a Pyrate, and if he had, he durst not have acted otherwise
than he has done, having no force to oppose them, and for that he hath
formerly been threatned to be killed by Privateers, if he should carry
unkindly to them.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Gardiner</span>.</p>

<p>The within named Narrator further saith That whilst Captain Kidd lay
with his Sloop at Gardners Island, there was a New Yorke Sloop,
whereof one Coster is Master, and his Mate was a little black man,
unknown to the Narrator by name,<a name="FNanchor_4_606" id="FNanchor_4_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_606" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who, as it was said, had been
formerly Captain Kidds Quarter Master, and another Sloop belonging to
New-Yorke, Jacob Fenick<a name="FNanchor_5_607" id="FNanchor_5_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_607" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Master, both which lay near to Kidds Sloop
three dayes together, and whilst the Narrator was on board with
Captain Kidd, there was several Bayles of Goods and other things put
out of the said Kidds Sloop and put on board the other two Sloops
aforesaid, and the said two Sloops sayled up the Sound. After which
Kidd sailed with his Sloop for Block Island, and being absent by the
Space of three dayes returned to Gardners-Island again in company of
another Sloop belonging to New-Yorke, Cornelius Quick Master, on board
of which was one Thomas Clarke of Setauket, commonly called Whisking
Clarke, and one Harrison of Jamaica, Father to a boy that was with
Captain Kidd, and Captain Kidds Wife was then on board his own
Sloop.<a name="FNanchor_6_608" id="FNanchor_6_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_608" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And Quick remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span> with his Sloop there from noon to the
evening of the same day, and tooke on board two Chests that came out
of the said Kidd's Sloop, under the observance of this Narrator, and
he believes several Goods more, and then sailed up the Sound. Kidd
remained there with his Sloop until next morning, and then set saile
intending, as he said, for Boston. Further the Narrator saith That the
next day after Quick sayled with his Sloop from Gardners Island, he
saw him turning out of a Bay called Oyster-pan Bay,<a name="FNanchor_7_609" id="FNanchor_7_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_609" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> although the
wind was all the time fair to carry him up the Sound; the Narrator
supposes he went in thither to land some Goods.</p>

<p><i>My Lords,</i></p>

<p>I gave your Lordships a short Account of my taking Capt. Kidd, in my
Letter of the 8th Instant:<a name="FNanchor_2_617" id="FNanchor_2_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_617" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I shall in this Letter confine myselfe
wholly to an Account of my Proceeding with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>On the 13th of last Month Mr. Emot, a Lawyer of New-York, came late at
Night to me and told me he came from Captain Kidd, who was on the
Coast with a Sloop, but would not tell me where: That Kidd had brought
60 Pound Weight of gold, about a 100 Weight of Silver, and 17 Bales of
East-India goods, (which was less by 24 Bales than we have since got
in the Sloop), That Kidd had left behind him a great Ship near the
Coast of Hispaniola that nobody but himselfe could find out, on board
whereof there were in bale goods, Saltpetre, and other things to the
Value of at least 30,000 L.: That if I would give him a pardon, he
would bring in the Sloop and goods hither, and would go and fetch the
great Ship and goods afterwards. Mr. Emot delivered me that Night Two
French Passes, which Kidd took on board the Two Moors Ships which were
taken by him in the seas of India (or, as he alleges, by his Men
against his Will). One of the Passes wants a date in the original, as
in the Copy I send your Lordships; and they go No. I. and No. II.<a name="FNanchor_3_618" id="FNanchor_3_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_618" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>On Thursday, the 15 of June, I sent Mr. Campbel, the Post-Master of
this town, Kidd's Countryman and acquaintance, along with Mr. Emot, to
invite Kidd to come into this Port. Mr. Campbel returned hither on the
19 of June, and gave in a Memorial to my selfe and the Councel,
containing what had passed between him and Kidd: The said Memorial
goes No. 3.<a name="FNanchor_4_619" id="FNanchor_4_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_619" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On the said 19 June, as I sate in Councel, I wrote a
Letter to Captain Kidd, and shewed it to the Councel, and they
approving of it, I dispatched Mr. Campbel again to Kidd with my said
Letter, a Copy whereof goes No. 4. Your Lordships may observe That the
promise I make Captain Kidd, in my said Letter, of a kind reception,
and promising the King's pardon for him, is conditionall; that is,
provided he were as innocent as he pretended to be. But I quickly
found sufficient Cause to suspect him very guilty, by the many lyes
and Contradictions he told me. I was so much upon my guard with Kidd
that, he arriving here on Saturday the [first] of this moneth, I would
not see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span> him but before witnesses; nor have I ever seen him since, but
in Councel twice or thrice that we examined him; and the day he was
taken up by the Constable, it happened to be by the door of my
Lodging,<a name="FNanchor_5_620" id="FNanchor_5_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_620" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and he rushed in and came running to me, the Constable
after him. I had him not seized till Thursday the 6th instant, for I
had a mind to discover where he had left the great Ship, and I thought
my selfe secure enough from his running away, because I took care not
to give him the least umbrage of my Design of seizing him, Nor had I
till that day that I produced my orders from Court for apprehending of
Kidd, communicated them to anybody. And I found it necessary to shew
my orders to the Councel, to animate them to join heartily with me in
securing Kidd, and examining his Affair nicely, to discover what we
could of his behaviour in his whole Voyage. Another reason why I took
him not up sooner was that he had brought his wife and Children hither
in the Sloop with him, who I believed he would not easily forsake. He
being examined twice or thrice by me and the Councel, and also some of
his men, I observed he seemed much disturbed, And the last time we
examined him I fancied he looked as if he were upon the wing, and
resolved to run away, and the Gentlemen of the Councel had some of
them the same thought with mine, so that I took their Consent in
seizing and committing him.<a name="FNanchor_6_621" id="FNanchor_6_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_621" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But the officers appointed to seize his
men were so careless as to let 3 or 4 of his men escape, which
troubled me the more because they were old New-York Pyrates. The next
thing the Councel and I did, was to appoint a Committee of trusty
persons to search for the goods and Treasure brought by Kidd and to
secure what they should find till the King's pleasure should be known
as to the Disposition thereof, as my orders from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span> Mr. Secretary Vernon
import. The said Committee were made up of Two Gentlemen of the
Councel, Two Merchants, and the Deputy Collector, whose names are to
the inclosed Inventory of the goods and Treasure. They searched Kidd's
Lodging, and found hid and made up in Two sea-beds, a bag of gold dust
and Ingots of the value of about 1000 L. and a bag of silver, part
money and part pieces and piggs of silver, value as set down in the
said Inventory. In the above bag of gold were several litle bags of
gold; all particulars are, I believe, very justly and exactly set down
in the Inventory. For my part, I have medled with no manner of thing,
but put every thing under the management of the Councel, and into the
Custody of the before mentioned Committee, that I might be free from
the Suspicion and Censure of the World. The enameled box mentioned in
the beginning of the Inventory is that which Kidd made a present of to
my wife by Mr. Campbel, which I delivered in Councel to the said
Committee to keep with the rest of the Treasure. There was in it a
stone ring, which we take to be a Bristoll Stone;<a name="FNanchor_7_622" id="FNanchor_7_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_622" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> if it were true,
it would be worth about 40 L. And there was a small stone unset which
we believe is also counterfeit, and a sort of a Locket, with four
Sparks which seem to be right diamonds; for there is nobody here that
understands Jewels. If the Box and all that is in it were right, they
cannot be worth above 60 L.</p>

<p>Your Lordships will see in the middle of the Inventory a parcel of
Treasure and Jewels delivered up by Mr. Gardiner, of Gardiner's
Island, in the Province of New-York, and at the East End of
Nassau-Island, the Recovering and saving of which Treasure is owing to
my Own Care and quickness. I heard by the greatest accident in the
world, the day that Captain Kidd was committed, That a Man had offered
30 L. for a Sloop to carry him to Gardiner's Island, and Kidd having
owned he had buried some Gold on that Island, (though he never
mentioned to us any Jewels, nor, I believe, would he have owned the
gold there but that he thought he should himselfe be sent for it), I
presently re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>flected that that man (whom I have since discovered to be
one of Kidd's Men) was to defeat us of that Treasure; I privately
posted away a Messenger by Land with a peremptory order to Mr.
Gardiner in the King's name to come forthwith, and deliver up such
Treasure as Kidd or any of his Crew had lodged with him; acquainting
him That I had committed Kidd to Goal, as I was ordered to do by the
King. My Messenger made great haste, and was with Gardiner before
anybody, and Gardiner, who is a very substantial man, brought away the
Treasure without delay, and by my direction delivered it into the
Hands of the Committee. If the Jewels be right, as it is supposed they
are, but I never saw them, nor the gold and silver brought by
Gardiner, then we guesse that the parcel brought by him may be worth
(Gold, Silver and Jewels) 4500 L. And besides Kidd had left Six bales
of goods with him, one of which was twice as big as any of the rest;
and Kidd gave him a particular Charge of that bale, and told him it
was worth 2000 L. The six bales Gardiner could not bring, but I have
ordered him to send them by a Sloop that is since gone from hence to
New York, and which is to return speedily. We are not able to set an
exact value on the goods and Treasure we have got, because we have not
opened the bales we took on board the Sloop; But we hope when the six
bales are sent in by Gardiner, what will be then in the hands of the
Gentlemen appointed to that Trust, will amount to about 14000 L. I
have sent strict orders to my Lieutenant Governor at New York,<a name="FNanchor_8_623" id="FNanchor_8_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_623" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to
make dilligent Search for the Goods and Treasure sent by Kidd to New
York in Three Sloops mentioned in Gardiner's affidavit,<a name="FNanchor_9_624" id="FNanchor_9_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_624" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which I
send with the other affidavits and Informations to your Lordships; and
I believe I have directed him where to find a Purchase in a house at
New York, which by a hint I have had I am apt to believe will be found
out in that house. I have sent to search elsewhere a certain place,
strongly suspected to have received another depositum of gold from
Kidd. I am also upon the hunt after Two or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span> Three Arch Pyrates, which
I hope to give your Lordships a good Account of by next Conveyance. If
I could have but a good able Judge and Attorney General at York, a Man
of war there and another here, and the Companies recruited and well
paid, I will rout Pirates and Piracy entirely out of all this north
part of America, but as I have but too often told your Lordships, it
is impossible for me to do all this alone in my single person.</p>

<p>I wrot your Lordships word in my last letter of the 8 Instant That
Bradish the Pyrate and one of his Crew were escaped out of the goal of
this Town. We have since found that the Goaler was Bradish's kinsman,
and the Goaler confessed they went out at the prison door, and that he
found it wide open; we had all the reason in the world to believe the
Goaler was consenting to the escape: by much ado I could get the
Counsel to resent the Goaler's behaviour, but by meer Importunity I
had the fellow before us; we examined him, and, by his own Story and
accounts given us of his suffering other prisoners formerly to escape,
I prevailed to have him turned out and a prosecution ordered against
him to the Attorney Generall. I have also, with some difficulty, this
late Session of Assembly here, got a bill to pass, That the Goal be
committed to the Care of the High Sheriffe of the County, as in
England, with a Salary of 30 L. <i>per Annum</i>, to the said Sheriffe: I
would have had it 50 L. <i>per Annum</i>, for the Sheriff's Incouragement
to be honest and carefull, but I could not prevail. I am forced to
allow the Sheriff 40 s. per Week for keeping Kidd safe; otherwise I
should be in some doubt about him. He has without doubt a great deal
of gold, which is apt to tempt men that have not principles of honour;
I have therefore, to try the power of dull Iron against gold, put him
into Irons that Weigh 16 Pound. I thought it moderate enough, for I
remember poor Doctor Oates<a name="FNanchor_10_625" id="FNanchor_10_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_625" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> had a 100 weight of Iron on him when he
was a prisoner in the late Raign. There never was a greater Lyar or
Thief in the World than this Kidd; not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>withstanding he assured the
Councel and me every time we examined him That the great Ship and her
Cargo waited his return to bring her hither, and now your Lordships
will see by Two severall Informations of Masters of Ships from
Curacao, that the Cargo has been sold there, and in one of them it is
said they have burnt that noble Ship, and without doubt, it was by
Kidd's order, that the Ship might not be an evidence against him, for
he would not own to us her Name was the <i>Quidah-Marchand</i>, though his
men did. Andries Henlyne, and Two more, brought the first news to York
of the sale of that Cargo at Curacao; and never such pennyworths heard
of for Cheapness; Captain Evertz is he who has brought the news of the
Ship's being burnt. She was of about 500 Ton, and Kidd told us at the
Councel, there never was a stronger or stancher Ship seen. His Lying
had like to have involved me in a Contract that would have been very
chargeable and to no manner of purpose, as he has ordered Matters. I
was advised by Counsel to dispatch a Ship of good Countenance to go
and fetch away that Ship and Cargo. I had agreed for a Ship of 300
tons, 22 Guns, and I was to man her with 60 men, to force (if there
had been need of it) the Men to yield who were left with the Ship. I
was just going to seal the writing, when I bethought myself it were
best to presse Kidd once more to tell me Truth: I therefore sent to
him Two Gentlemen of the Councel to the Goal, and he at last owned
That he had left a power with one Mr. Henry Bolton, a Marchand of
Antegoa whom he had Committed the Care of the Ship to, to sell and
dispose of all the Cargo: upon which Confession of Kidds I held my
hand from hireing that great Ship, which would have cost 1700 L. by
Computation. And now to-morrow I send the Sloop Captain Kidd came in,
with Letters to the Lieutenant Governor of Antegoa, Colonel Yeomans,
to the Governors of St. Thomas's Island and Curacao, to seize and
secure what effects they can, that was late in the possession of Kidd,
and on board the <i>Quidah-Marchand</i>. There is one Burk, an Englishman,
that lives at St. Thomas, who has got a great Store of the goods and
mony for Kidd's account. St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span> Thomas belongs to the Danes, but I hope
to retrieve what Burt has in his Hands.<a name="FNanchor_11_626" id="FNanchor_11_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_626" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The sending this Sloop
will cost but about 300 L. if she be out Three moneths. I hope your
Lordships will take care, that immediate orders be sent to Antegoa to
secure Bolton, who must have plaid the Knave egregiously; for he could
not but know that Kidd came knavishly by that Ship and Goods. It is
reported That the Dutch of Curacao have loaded Three Sloops with those
Goods, and sent them to Holland; perhaps it were not amiss to send and
watch their Arrivall in Holland, if it be practicable to lay Claim to
them there.</p>

<p>Since my Committment of Kidd, I hear That upon his approach to this
port, his heart misgave him, and he proposed to his Men the putting to
Sea again and going to Caledonia,<a name="FNanchor_12_627" id="FNanchor_12_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_627" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the new Scotch Settlement near
Darien, but they refused.</p>

<p>I desire I may have orders what to do with Kidd, and all his and
Bradish's Crew; for, as the Law stands in this Country, if a pyrate
were Convict, yet he cannot suffer Death: And the Counsell here
refused the bill to punish Privateers and Pyrates which your Lordships
sent with me from England with a direction to recommend it at New York
and here, to be passed into a Law. I shall by next Conveyance acquaint
your Lordships what a prejudice I have found in some of the Counsel to
the Laws of England this Session, but having writ myself almost dead,
I must till another Opportunity forbear to treat of the affairs of
this Province; but when I do, I must tell your Lordships beforehand, I
will not dissemble with you to favour any man or number of men; I am
both above it, and I should thinke I did not do the part of an honest
man, if I concealed any thing from you that tends to the prejudice of
the Interest of England.</p>

<p>You will observe by some of the Informations I now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span> send, That Kidd
did not only rob the Two Moors Ships, but also a Portugueze Ship;
which he denied absolutely to the Counsel and me.</p>

<p>I send your Lordships 24 severall Papers and Evidences relating to
Captain Kidd. It is impossible for me to animadvert and make remarks
on the several matters contained in the said papers, in the weak
Condition I am at present; but must leave that Trouble to Mr.
Secretary Popple,<a name="FNanchor_13_628" id="FNanchor_13_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_628" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> whose excellent clear method in business fits
him incomparably beyond me for such a Work.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Thomas</span>, September 1, 1699.</p>

<p><i>To His Excellency Bellomont:</i></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>My Lord:</i></span></p>

<p>I have had the honor to receive by way of Captain &mdash;&mdash; Carry<a name="FNanchor_2_630" id="FNanchor_2_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_630" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Your
Excellency's agreeable letter of July 26, and to understand fully from
it what Your Excellency has been pleased to write as to the pirate
Will Kidd, upon which I shall serve Your Excellency with the following
reply. The aforesaid Will Kidd, with his freight-ship under the
English flag, came to anchor off this harbor, out of range of the
King's fortress, and then sent his shallop to land with a letter to
me, in which he asked me for protection, further declaring that he was
innocent as to robbing the subjects of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span> Mogul in the East Indies.
His course of conduct being at that time still unknown to me, I wrote
him in reply that, in case he was an honorable man, I would protect
him, but he wished to have assurance that I would not give him up to
any war-ship of His Majesty of Great Britain that should come to
demand him. This I declined to give, whereupon he, understanding that
I had forbidden all inhabitants to sell him any provisions, set sail
again.<a name="FNanchor_3_631" id="FNanchor_3_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_631" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Since that time I have heard that he lay at anchor near the
island of Mona, and that one Bolton of Antigua had been with him, to
transact business. Afterward there came into this harbor a brigantine
belonging to Barbados, on which one Will Burcke<a name="FNanchor_4_632" id="FNanchor_4_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_632" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was merchant,
concerning whom I had no suspicion, still less the thought that he
would dare to undertake bringing in here any pirate goods; yet I
learned the other day that he by night had brought a quantity of goods
to land, which, according to reports, he had sold to Mr. Pedro van
Bellen, general director for the Electoral Brandenburg Privileged
Company, and which are also stored in the Brandenburg warehouse.<a name="FNanchor_5_633" id="FNanchor_5_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_633" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I
have not been able to get at the aforesaid goods, because the said
Brandenburg patentees have here their own law and privileges, but I
have caused the said Will Burcke to be arrested, and on his giving
bail have let him return with the brigantine, yet on condition that he
should discharge his responsibility to Barbadoes, he being a subject
of His Majesty of England and resident there. Since that time he has
come here again from Barbados, bringing with him a recommendation from
Gover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>nor Grey<a name="FNanchor_6_634" id="FNanchor_6_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_634" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to me, and is living here still at the Brandenburg
Lodge, but all the aforesaid goods have, it is said, been transported
to other places. This is all the information that I can give Your
Excellency respecting this matter, at the same time assuring you that
no subjects of his Royal Majesty of Denmark, my sovereign Lord, or
inhabitants here, have traded with the aforesaid Kidd, for in that
matter I have enforced good order. Meanwhile I have forthwith sent a
member of the council to Denmark, to report most submissively to His
Royal Majesty, my most gracious King and Lord, all these matters just
as they have occurred. Herewith closing, and commending myself to Your
Excellency, to maintain all good friendship and further good
correspondence, I remain</p>

Lorentz, acting governor of the Danish island of St. Thomas 1689-1692,
governor 1694-1702, was of Flensborg in Sleswick, but his habitual

at this time. His letter, written in Dutch, was sent to the Board of
Trade as an enclosure in a letter from Bellomont dated Oct. 24.
Bellomont, as indicated in the latter part of <a href="#DOC_82">doc. no. 82</a>, sent the

Jamaica, to recover whatever could be found of Kidd's booty. This is

Lorentz "answered that if he could produce proof in writing that he
was an honest man, he might enter". From his request for protection

<p><i>My Lords</i></p>

<p>I gave your Lordships an account in my Letter of the 24th of last
moneth<a name="FNanchor_2_638" id="FNanchor_2_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_638" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> by the last ship that went hence for England, of my taking
Joseph Bradish and Tee Wetherley, the two Pyrates that had escaped
from the Goal of this town;<a name="FNanchor_3_639" id="FNanchor_3_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_639" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and I then also writ that I hoped in a
little time to be able to send your Lordships the news of my taking
James Gill[am] the Pyrat that killed Captain Edgecomb, Commander of
the <i>Mocha</i> frigat for the East India Company,<a name="FNanchor_4_640" id="FNanchor_4_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_640" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and that with his
own hand while the Captain was asleep, and Gillam is supposed to be
the man that Incouraged the Ship's Company to turn Pyrats, and that
ship has ever since been robbing in the Red Sea and Seas of India, and
taken an Incredible deal of wealth; if one may believe the reports of
men that are lately come from Madagascar, and that saw the <i>Mocha</i>
frigat there, she has taken above two millions sterling. I have been
so lucky as to take James Gillam, and he is now in Irons in the Goal
of this town, and at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span> same time with him was sie[ze]d one Francis
Dole,<a name="FNanchor_5_641" id="FNanchor_5_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_641" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in whose house he was harboured, who proves to be one of
Hore's Crew, H[ore] one of Colonel Fletcher's Pyrates commissioned by
him from New York; Dole is also committed to Goal. My taking of Gillam
was so very accidentall that I cannot forbear giving your Lordships a
narrative of it, and one would believe there was a strange fatality in
that m[an's] Starrs. On Saturday the 11th Instant late in the evening
I had a letter from Colonel Sanford,<a name="FNanchor_6_642" id="FNanchor_6_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_642" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Judge [of] the Admiralty Court
in Rhode-Island, giving me an account that Gillam had been there, but
was come towards Boston a fortnight before, in order to ship himselfe
for some of the Islands, Jamaica or Barbados, that he was troubled he
knew it not sooner, and was affraid his Intelligence would come too
late to me; that the Messenger he sent knew the Mare Gillam rode on
[to] this town. I was in despair of finding the man, because Colonel
Sanford writ to me that he was g[one] to this town so long a time as a
fortnight before that; however I sent for an honest Constable I had
made use of in the apprehending of Kidd and his men, and sent him with
Colonel Sanford's Messenger to examine and search all the Inns in Town
for the mare, and at the first Inn they went to, they found her tied
up in the yard; the people of the Inn reported that the man that
brought her thither, had lighted off her about a quarter of an hour
before, had there tied her, but went away without saying anything to
anybody. Upon notice of this I gave order to the Master of the Inn
that if any body came to look after the mare, he should be sure to
seize and secure him, but no body came for her. The next morning which
was Sunday I summoned [a] Council, and we published a Proclamation,
wherein I promised a reward of 200[l.] for the seizing and securing
Gillam, whereupon there was the strictest search [all that] day, and
the next, that was ever made in this part of the world, but we had
missed him, if I had not been Informed of one Captain Knot, as an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Pyrate and therefore likely [to k]now where Gillam was concealed.<a name="FNanchor_7_643" id="FNanchor_7_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_643" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I
sent for Knot and examined him, promising h[im if h]e would make an
Ingenious Confession, I would not molest or prosecute him; he seemed
[mu]ch disturbed, but would not confesse anything to purpose. I then
sent for his wife and examined her on oath apart from her husband, and
she confessed that one who went by the [name] of James Kelly had
lodged severall nights in her house, but for some nights past [lo]dged
as she believed in Charlestown Crosse the River. I knew he went by the
name of Kelly, [the]n I examined Captain Knot again, telling him his
wife had been more free and ingenious [tha]n him, which made him
believe she had told all; and then he told me of Francis Dole in
Charlestown, and that he believed Gillam would be found there. I sent
half a dousin men immediately over the water to Charlestown and Knot
with them, they beset the house, and searched it but found not the
man, Dole affirming with many protestations he was not there, neither
knew [of] any such man. Two of the men went through a field behind
Dole's house, and passing [thr]ough a second field they met a man in
the dark (for it was ten a clock at night) whom they [seize]d at all
adventures, and it happened as oddly as luckily to be Gillam, he had
been treating [some] young women some few miles off in the Country,
and was returning at night to his Landlord Dole's house, and so was
met with. I examined him, but he denied everything, even that he came
with Kidd from Madagascar, or ever saw him in his life; but Captain
Davies,<a name="FNanchor_8_644" id="FNanchor_8_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_644" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who also came thence with Kidd, and all Kidd's men, are
positive he is the man and that he went by his true name viz. Gillam,
all the while he was on the voyage with them, and Mr. Campbel the
Postmaster of this town (whom I sent to treat with Kidd) offers to
swear this is the man he saw on [bo]ard Kidd's sloop under the name of
James Gillam. He is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span> most impudent hardened V[illai]n I ever saw
in my whole life. That which led me to an Inquiry and search after
this man [was t]he Information of William Cuthbert on oath, which I
sent your Lordships with my packet of the 26th of this last July,<a name="FNanchor_9_645" id="FNanchor_9_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_645" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
wherein Cuthbert Informs that being lately in the East India Company's
service [it w]as commonly reported there that Gillam had killed
Captain Edgecomb with his own hand, that he had [s]erved the Mogul,
turned Mahometan and was Circumcised. I had him searched by a
[su]rgeon and also by a Jew in this Town, to know if he were
Circumcised, and they have both declared on oath that he is. Mr.
Cutler the surgeon's<a name="FNanchor_10_646" id="FNanchor_10_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_646" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> deposition goes (No. 1) and Mr. Frazon the
Jew's (No. 2).<a name="FNanchor_11_647" id="FNanchor_11_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_647" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The rest of the Evidences about Gillam and some
other Pyrates go numbered from 3 to 23 inclusive, which I recommend to
your Lordships perusall, as what will inform you of the strange
Countenance given to Pyrats by the Government and people of
[Rhode]-Island. I have numbered the papers in order of time and
according to their dates: most have reference to Gillam, some to Kidd.
In searching the forementioned Captain Knot's house [a smal]l trunk
was found with some remnants of East India goods, and a Letter from
Kidd's wife to Captain Thomas Pain an old Pyrat living on Canonicot
Island in Rhode Island Governm[ent.]<a name="FNanchor_12_648" id="FNanchor_12_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_648" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The affidavit he made when I
was at Rhode-Island goes numbered among the other evide[nce.] He then
made oath that he had received nothing from Kidd's sloop when she lay
at anchor by [<i>torn</i>] Island, yet by Knot's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span> deposition your Lordships
will find, he was sent with Mrs. Kidd's letter to Pa[in for] 24 ounces
of gold, which Knot accordingly brought; and Mrs. Kidd's Injunction to
Pain to keep a[ll the] rest that was left with him till further order,
was a plain Indication that there was a good deal of [trea]sure still
behind in Pain's Custody, therefore I posted away a messenger to
Governor Crans[ton]<a name="FNanchor_13_649" id="FNanchor_13_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_649" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and Colonel Sanford to make a strict search of
Pain's house before he could have notice; it see[ms] nothing was then
found, but Pain has since produced 18 ounces and odd weight of gold,
as appears by Cranston's Letter of the 25th Instant and pretends it
was bestowed on him by Kidd, hoping that may p[rove (?)] a salvo for
the oath he made when I was in Rhode-Island, but I think it is plain
he forswore himselfe then, and I am of opinion he has a great deal
more of Kidd's gold still in his hands. [But] he is out of my power,
and being in that Government I cannot compell him to deliver up th....</p>

<p>Your Lordships will find in Captain Coddington's narrative number
35<a name="FNanchor_14_650" id="FNanchor_14_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_650" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and sent with my Report dated the 27th Instant an Inventory of
gold and Jew[els] in Governor Cranston's hands which he took from a
Pyrat. I see no reason why he should keep them ... so far from that,
that he (with submission) ought to be called to an account for
Conniving at the Py[rats] making that Island their Sanctuary, and
suffering some to escape from Justice. If there be an order sent to
him to deliver what gold and jewels is contained in the said
Inventory, and also the formentio[ned] parcel of gold which he
received from Pain, with all other goods and treasure which he has at
any time rec[eived] from Privateers or Pyrates, into my hands for the
use of his Majesty, and that upon oath, I will [see] the order
executed, and will give a faithfull account thereof according to the
order I shall re[ceive].</p>

<p>Four pound weight of the gold brought from Gardiner's Island which I
formerly acquainted your Lordships of, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span> all the Jewels, belonged
to Gillam, as Mr. Gardiner's Letter to Mr. Dummer,<a name="FNanchor_15_651" id="FNanchor_15_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_651" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> a Marchand in
t[he] town and one of the Committee appointed by me and the Council to
receive all the treasure and goods which [were] brought in Kidd's
sloop, will prove; and there is some proof of it in Captain
Coddington's b[efore men]tioned narrative, and in Captain Knot's
deposition of the 14th Instant. I am told that as Vice A[dmiral] of
these provinces I am entitled to 1/3 part of Gillam's said gold and
Jewels; I know not whe[ther I] am or no, but if it be my right I hope
your Lordships will please to represent to the King the ext[reme]
pains and vigilance I have used in taking these severall Pyrates, and
that I may have my [por]tion of the said gold and Jewels, if there be
any due to me. It is a great prejudice to the King's s[ervice] that
here is no Revenue or other fund to answer any occasion or service of
Majestys. I have [been] forced to disburse the 200 pieces of 8/8 for
the taking of Gillam out of my own little stock and also to [de]fray
my journey and other expences in going to Rhode-Island to execute the
King's Commission [and] Instructions. Both accounts I now send, and
beg your Lordships favour in promoting and Countenancing the payment
of that mony to Sir John Stanley for my use. Captain Gullock<a name="FNanchor_16_652" id="FNanchor_16_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_652" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> tells
[me] that 15 or 16 of the ship's Company that would not be concerned
with Gillam and his accomplices in murdering Captain Edgecomb, and
afterwards turning Pyrates, went home to England in [the] Ship
<i>America</i> belonging to the East India Company, Captain Laycock
Commander. I should thi[nk an] advertisement in the Gazette requiring
some of those men to appear before one of the Sec[retaries] of State
to give their evidence of what they know of that matter, would be
proper.</p>

<p>[Your] Lordships will meet with a passe among the other papers, number
5, to Sion Arnold, one of the [pirat]es brought from Madagascar by
Shelley of New York, the said passe signed by Mr. Basse,<a name="FNanchor_17_653" id="FNanchor_17_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_653" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
[Go]vernor of East and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span> West Jerzies, which is a bold step in Basse
after such positive orders as he received from [Govern]or<a name="FNanchor_18_654" id="FNanchor_18_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_654" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Vernon,
but I perceive plainly the meaning of it, he took severall Pirats at
Burlington [in West] Jerzey, and a good store of mony with them as it
is said, and I daresay he would be glad they [should] escape, for when
they are gone, who can witnesse what money he seized with them? I know
[the] man so well, that I verily believe that is his plot. John Carr
mentioned in some of the [papers to (?)] be in Rhode Island, No. 6,
was one of Hore's Crew. There are abundance of other Pyrats in that
[Is]land at this time, but they are out of my power. Mr. Brinley,<a name="FNanchor_19_655" id="FNanchor_19_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_655" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Colonel Sanford, and Captain Coddington are honest men, and of the
best estates in the Island, and because they are heartily [wea]ry of
the male administrations of that Government, and because too I
commissioned them (by [virt]ue of the authority and power given me by
his Majesty's Commission and Instructions so to do) to [make] Inquiry
into the Irregularities of those people, they are become strangely
odious to them and [are o]ften affronted by them, neither will they
make them Justices of the peace; so that when they [w]ould commit
Pyrates to Goal, they are forced to go to the Governor for his
Warrant, and very ... ly the Pyrates get notice, and avoid the Warrant
for that time. You may please to o[bser]ve too that Gardiner the
Deputy Collector<a name="FNanchor_20_656" id="FNanchor_20_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_656" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is accused to have been once a Pyrat, in one of
the [paper]s. I doubt he will forswear himselfe rather than part with
Gillam's gold which is in his hands. [It is] impossible for me to
transmit to the Lords of the Treasury these proofs against Gardiner.
[I am] so jaded with writing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span> that I cannot write to them by this
Conveyance, but I could wish [your Lordships might be (?)] made
acquainted with Gardiner's Character, and that they would send over
honest In&mdash;&mdash;t men to be Collectors of Rhode Island, Conecticut, and
New Hampshire; and that they [would h]asten Mr. Brenton<a name="FNanchor_21_657" id="FNanchor_21_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_657" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> hither to
his post, or send some other Collector in his room. I could [wish]
that Mr. Weaver were ordered to hasten to New York. Your Lordships may
please to observe that [Knott] in one of his depositions accuses
Gillam to have pyrated four years together in the [Sou]th sea against
the Spaniards.</p>

<p>We have advice that Burk an Irishman and Pyrat that committed severall
robberies on th[e] [coast] of Newfoundland, is drowned with all his
ship's Company, except 7 or 8 persons somewh[ere to the] southward. It
is said he perished in the hurrican that was in those Seas about the
end of [July and] beginning of August last. It is good news, he was
very strong if we may believe report, [and is s]aid to have had a good
ship with a 140 men, and 24 guns.</p>

<p>[Bra]dish and Wetherley have a slight extraordinary in attempting to
escape, they [made] two attempts since they were last committed, once
they broke the floor of the prison and thought to escape that way, but
that failing them, within a night or two they filed off their fetters,
upon which I ordered them to be manicled, and chained to one another.
I believe this new Goaler I have got is honest, otherwise I should be
very uneasy for fear these Pyrats should escape....<a name="FNanchor_22_658" id="FNanchor_22_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_658" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p class="center">Information of Henry Bolton.</p>

<p class="right">4th of February 1700</p>

<p>Being required by the Right hono'ble the Commission'rs for Executing
the office of High Admiral of England, Ireland etc. to informe their
Lord'ps of the place of my nativity, manner of Living for some time in
the West Indies, and particularly of my meeting and Transactions with
Capt. Kidd, I presume to make the following Answer, being the best and
fullest I can make at present having neither my Books or papers in
this Kingdome.</p>

<p>That I was born in Worcestershire about the yeare 1672 and in the year
1697 was Deputed by the Commissioners of his Maj'ties Customes for the
Leeward Islands to be Collector for the Island of Antigua.</p>

<p>That in the year 1698 following I quitted that Imployment<a name="FNanchor_2_660" id="FNanchor_2_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_660" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
followed Merchandizing about the said Leeward Islands.</p>

<p>That in February 1698/9 I sailed from Antigua in the Sloop <i>St.
Antonie</i>, Samuel Wood Master, on a Trading Voyage amongst the Dutch
and Spaniards. The Markett at Curacoa (a Dutch Island) not answering
my Ends I went to Rio De la Hacha,<a name="FNanchor_3_661" id="FNanchor_3_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_661" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and there sold my Cargoe, and
Loaded my Sloope with Stock Fish [and] Wood on Freight for Curacoa
aforesaid, which I there Landed and departed for the Island of Porto
Rico with intention to Trade with the Inhabitants of that Island,
having a Cargo on Board for that purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>That in that Voyage in the Moneth of Aprill 1699 being becalmed to the
N.N.E. of the Island Mona the Men belonging to the Sloop discovered a
Sail E. and B.S.<a name="FNanchor_4_662" id="FNanchor_4_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_662" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> from Mona which the Pilote of the Sloope supposed
to be a Guarda Costa, a small vessell fitted out by the Spanish
Governors to clear the Coast of Foreign Traders. A few houres after
Wee discovered a Cannoa, which drawing near the Sloope, Wee hailed the
said Cannoa. They answered from Whitehall. Wee demanded who Commanded
their Shipp. They Replyed Capt. Kidd. Then he that stired<a name="FNanchor_5_663" id="FNanchor_5_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_663" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the
Cannoa was desired to come on Board. After he came he told me his name
was John Ware, and that he was Master of Capt. Kidd's Ship, requesting
that I would goe on Board in the Cannoa to see Capt. Kidd which
accordingly I did. When I came there Captain Kidd askt me to sell him
my Sloope in regard his Ship was disabled and could not well proceed
the voyage he intended for New Yorke, and finding me unwilling he then
askt if I could not procure him a Vessell. I answered possibly I might
at Curacao, upon which he desired me to use my Endeavors there to get
him a Sloope, and procure him some Buyers or Chapmen<a name="FNanchor_6_664" id="FNanchor_6_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_664" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> for his
Calicos and Muslings, And that he would consider me for my paynes.</p>

<p>That thereupon I departed from Capt. Kidd and went for Curacao where I
applyed my selfe to Mr John Stonehouse and Mr Walter Gribble<a name="FNanchor_7_665" id="FNanchor_7_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_665" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
(Acquaintance of Captain Kidd) who promised to send A Sloope to him. I
also Endeavored to procure him some Buyers for the Muslings and
Callicos.</p>

<p>That after doing my Errand and business at Curacao I ordered the
Master of the Sloope to shape his Course for the West End of Porto
Rico, But the Wind proving Northerly Wee fell in with the East end of
Savona and plyed to Winward for Mona in order to meet Captain Kidd,
which I there did according to Appointm't and with him a Dutch Sloope,
Jean Vander Bist Master, and a French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span> Turtler, the Master's name I
have forgot; Captain Kidd waited at Mona for the Curacao vessells But
the Wind being about No. and from thence to NNE they could not
possibly Fetch Mona, So Captain Kidd's patience being tyred gott his
ship under Saile and intended to Weather point Esperdo,<a name="FNanchor_8_666" id="FNanchor_8_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_666" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the
Eastermost part of Hispaniola, but the Deficiencies of his Ship being
so great he bore away for the West end of Savona, and there Anchored.
a Day or two afterwards came into Our Company the Brigandin <i>Mary
Gold</i>, George Lorriston Master, and the <i>Elenora</i>, John Duncan Master.
Then Cap't Kidd weighed Anchor with the sloop <i>Spey</i>, John Vander Bist
Master, and Brigandine <i>Mary Gold</i>, sailed for the River Higuey in the
Island Hispaniola where Arriving he moored his ship across the River
to the Stumps of Trees or Rocks on shoar.</p>

<p>That there Capt. Kidd disposed of wine, part of his Cargoe, to
severall that came on Board to him And that at the same time I sold
him the Sloope <i>St. Antonio</i>.</p>

<p>That Capt. Kidd tooke severall Goods out of his ship, and put them on
Board the Sloope I sould him and left his owne ship in the River
Higuey and desired me to doe him all the service I could in selling
and disposeing of the Goods left on Board of the said ship for Account
of the Owners of the <i>Adventure Galley</i>.</p>

<p>That Captain Kidd told me that my Lord Bellomont and my Lord of
Orford<a name="FNanchor_9_667" id="FNanchor_9_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_667" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and himselfe were some of the <i>Adventure Galleys</i> owners and
to the best of my Remembrance Sir John Somers.</p>

<p>That Capt. Kidd shewed me a Commission under the Great Seale signed at
the Topp William Rex and another Commission signed by the Lords of the
Admiralty, the purport of neither of which I can remember, onely Capt.
Kidd sayd his Commissions impowred him to take pirates and the
subjects of the French King.</p>

<p>That Capt. Kidd at his going to New Yorke promised to return himselfe
or send some other persons in two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span> Moneths time to bring Necessaryes
for refitting his said ship the <i>Adventure Prize</i> and also a
Condemnation for the said ship and Goods and to indempnifye all
persons that should purchase any of the said Goods, alledging that the
said ship was a lawfull prize being taken with a French passe which
Captain Kidd shewed me, and actually in the time of War with
France.<a name="FNanchor_10_668" id="FNanchor_10_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_668" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>That after the Departure of Capt. Kidd the Seamen shiped by him in the
said ship did plunder and convert to their owne uses the best and most
choicest of the goods of the said ships Cargoe, which did not come to
my Knowledge till they had been near Five Weeks on board the said
ship, and indeed it was out of my power to prevent them had I
discovered it sooner being only myselfe and Negro Boy, And they were
Eighteen in numbers.</p>

<p>That the said Seamen belonging to the said ship as afores'd when they
found I was not ignorant of their villanies openly declared they would
not stay longer on board the said ship, but being terrified with the
thoughts of Capt Kidds returning, they Joyned all (saving the
Boatswaine) and came on the Quarter Deck and said I might remain in
the ship and be damned for they would stay no longer. The Man that
thus affronted me I shoved on the main Deck<a name="FNanchor_11_669" id="FNanchor_11_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_669" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and ordered the rest
to go on the Main Deck likewise and told them they had engaged
themselves to Capt. Kidd to stay on board the ship as long as I should
be there, And that I was resolved to stay till the two Months in which
Capt. Kidd promised to return were expired unless some Extraordinary
Accident intervened: I also charged them with stealing out of the
Ships Hould severall Bales of Goods And that if they went from the
Ship before Capt. Kidd's Arrivall I was oblidged as his Friend and in
my owne Justification to write to all Governm'ts in those parts to
have them secured; this calmed them for two or three dayes.</p>

<p>That the said Seamen did again Joyne and draw up a Paper directed to
me setting forth their Resolution of leaving the Ship and signed with
their names within a Circle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span> commonly called a Round Robin, so gott on
board A Sloope and went for the Island Curacao leaving the Ship to me
and three more.</p>

<p>That after the departure of the said Seamen I stayd about a Week in
the ship and would have stayed longer had not a Friend of myne sent a
Sloope Express from Curacao to informe me the Spaniards of the Citty
of St. Domingo<a name="FNanchor_12_670" id="FNanchor_12_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_670" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> were arming out a Brigandine to come and take us,
which induced me to leave the said ship <i>Adventure Prize</i> in the said
River Higuey and went to the Island Curacao in order to protest ag't
the Seamen as aforesaid and to get what satisfaction the Law would
allow, For at that time they had most of them three or Four hundred
pounds a Man. But the said Seamen had gained their Ends so farr in the
Governm't that the Governor would not admitt me to stay in Curacao
tho' at the same time John Ware Master of Capt. Kidd's ship and the
said seamen were there openly protected; I do not charge this on the
Govern'r<a name="FNanchor_13_671" id="FNanchor_13_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_671" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> (who is since dead) For I should be very sorry to
disturbe the Ashes of so good a Gentleman as I believe he was, but on
some of his Councill that did not desire I should face them.</p>

<p>That I have not received of the produce of the Goods Capt. Kidd left
upwards of three hundred and Eighty peices of Eight, all the rest is
in Debts outstanding which is much less than my Charges.<a name="FNanchor_14_672" id="FNanchor_14_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_672" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><i>May it please Y'r Hon'r</i></p>

<p>The long Imprisonment I have undergone, or the tryall I am to
undergoe, are not soe great an affliction to me, as my not being able
to give your Hon'ble House of Commons such satisfaction as was
Expected from me. I hope I have not offended against the Law, but if I
have, It was the fault of others who knew better, and made me the Tool
of their Ambition and Avarice, and who now perhaps think it their
Interest that I should be removed out of the world.</p>

<p>I did not seek the Commission I undertook, but was partly Cajold, and
partly menac'd into it by the Lord Bellomont, and one Robert
Livingston of New York, who was the projector, promoter, and Chief
Manager of that designe, and who only can give your House a
satisfactory account of all the Transactions of my Owners. He was the
man admitted into their Closets, and received their private
Instructions, which he kept in his own hands, and who encouraged me in
their names to doe more than I ever did, and to act without regard to
my Commission. I would not Exceed my Authority, and took noe other
ships than such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span> as had French passes, which I brought with me to New
England, and relyed upon for my Justification. But my Lord Bellomont
seized upon them together with my Cargoe, and tho he promised to send
them into England, yet has he detained part of the effects, kept these
passes wholly from me, and has stript me of all the Defence I have to
make, which is such Barbarous, as well as dishonorable usage, as I
hope Your Hon'ble House will not let an Englishman suffer, how
unfortunate soever his Circumstances are; but will intercede with his
Maj'ty to defer my tryall till I can have those passes, and that
Livingston may be brought under Your Examination, and Confronted by
me.<a name="FNanchor_2_674" id="FNanchor_2_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_674" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>I cannot be so unjust to my selfe, as to plead to an Indictment till
the French passes are restored to me, unlesse I would be accessary to
my own destruction,<a name="FNanchor_3_675" id="FNanchor_3_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_675" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> for though I can make proof that the ships I
took had such passes, I am advised by Council, that It will little
avail me without producing the passes themselves. I was in great
Consternation when I was before that great Assembly, Your Hon'ble
House, which with the disadvantages of a mean Capacity, want of
Education, and a Spirit Cramped by Long Confinem't, made me Uncapable
of representing my Case; and I have therefore presumed to send your
Honor a short and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span> true state of It, which I humbly beg Your Honors
perusall, and Communication of to the House, if you think it worthy
their Notice.<a name="FNanchor_4_676" id="FNanchor_4_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_676" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>I humbly crave leave to acquaint Your Honor that I was not privy to my
being sent for up to Your House the second time, nor to the paper
lately printed in my name<a name="FNanchor_5_677" id="FNanchor_5_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_677" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (both which may justly give Offence to
the House) but I owe the first to a Coffeeman in the Court of Wards
who designed to make a shew of me, for his profit; and the latter was
done by one Newy a prisoner in Newgate to get money for his support,
at the hazard of my safety.</p>

<p>I humbly beg the Compassion and protection of the Hon'ble House of
Commons, and Your Honors intercession with them on behalfe of</p>

<p class="center">Your Honors<br />
Most Dutifull and Distressed Serv't</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_673" id="Footnote_1_673"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_673">[1]</a> From the manuscripts of the Duke of Portland at Welbeck
Abbey. The Historical Manuscripts Commission's calendar of those
archives, IV. 16, wrongly gives this petition the same date as the
next document, May 12, 1701. This petition was written before the
trials, which occurred on May 8 and 9, but after Kidd's appearances
before the House of Commons, which occurred on Mar. 27 and 31;
<i>Commons Journal</i>, XIII. 441, 463. Kidd, Gillam, Bradish, Witherley,
and 28 other pirates, mostly members of Kidd's crew, were shipped from
Boston soon after March 6, 1700 (eight months after his arrest), on
the <i>Advice</i> frigate, and arrived in the Downs Apr. 11, the day on
which King William brought to an end, by prorogation, the session of
Parliament. In that session, chiefly as a means of attacking Somers,
the lord chancellor, a party in the House of Commons had assailed the
grant of letters patent under which Kidd's enterprise had been
undertaken (Dec. 6, 1699). They were outvoted, but on Mar. 16, 1700, a
vote was passed for addressing the king that Kidd should not be tried,
discharged, or pardoned till the next session of Parliament. The
Admiralty concurred, May 2. The new Parliament came together Feb. 6,
1701; Harley was chosen speaker Feb. 11; the impeachment of Somers and
Orford, in which the contract with Kidd was made the basis of one
article, was voted Apr. 14.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_674" id="Footnote_2_674"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_674">[2]</a> Whether the presence of the French passes at the trial
for piracy would have brought about Kidd's acquittal may be doubted,
courts of justice being what they were; at all events Kidd, though he
clamored for them from the day of his arrival in the Downs (<i>Portland
MSS.</i>, VIII. 78) till the day he was sentenced, was never able to
recover them. The admiralty court refused to consider them. "Where are
they?" said the Lord Chief Baron Ward. Kidd's counsel could only
reply, "We cannot yet tell whether they are in the Admiralty-Office,
or whether Mr. Jodrell [clerk of the House of Commons] hath them".
<i>State Trials</i>, V. 290. In point of fact the House of Commons, which
had had all the papers before it for examination, had on Apr. 16, on
information that Kidd desired the use of his papers at his trial,
ordered the clerk to deliver them to the secretary of the Admiralty.
<i>Commons Journal</i>, XIII. 379, 380, 496.&mdash;A photographic facsimile of
the pass of the <i>Cara</i> (<i>Quedah</i>) <i>Merchant</i> is in Paine, <i>Book of
Buried Treasure</i>, at p. 104.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_675" id="Footnote_3_675"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_675">[3]</a> So when first arraigned, he tried to avoid pleading
(<i>ibid.</i>, 287), but he was tried first for the murder of William
Moore, on which the passes had no bearing. William Moore was an
insubordinate gunner; after an altercation, Kidd hit him on the head
with a bucket, and he died. It was probably manslaughter, but the jury
sustained the indictment for murder. After being condemned for murder,
Kidd was tried (unfairly in several particulars) and condemned for
piracy.</p></div>

the Earl of Crawford, from which it is reprinted in Professor Firth's
<i>Naval Songs and Ballads</i>, pp. 134-37, published by the Navy Records

There are bits of it in Palfrey, <i>New England</i>, IV. 185, and in

which, with some differences in the order of stanzas, is printed in
Dr. E.E. Hale's <i>New England History in Ballads</i>, pp. 40-46. The
original version, which we print, purports to be written between
sentence and execution, May 9-23, 1701, and follows closely the chief

for the Ship, and left several bayles on board the Ship wch this
Examinant Supposeth the said Mr. Brett bought of him: said Rogers
declared that he came from the Coast of Guinea, saying also that he
had been at Madagascar, and the Examinant saw the sd Rogers Sell
several Bayles of Goods at Crabb Island to several Merchants that came
thither: which Bayles were opened and contained Silke Muslins and
other Muslins, Callico's and other East India Goods, and sd Rogers
said he had remitted home to his owners the value of Twenty seven
Thousand pounds in money by good bills of Exchange. and after the
Examin't left Crabb Island with his Ship he Stopt at Portreico,<a name="FNanchor_3_688" id="FNanchor_3_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_688" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
tooke in some Ballast and Provisions and came directly for New
England, Mr. Brett aforesd, his Merchant and part owner, being on
board, and when they came into the Massachusetts Bay as high as the
Gurnett<a name="FNanchor_4_689" id="FNanchor_4_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_689" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> off Plymouth, they spoke to a Sloop that was then fishing
in the Bay to come onboard, and sd Brett treated with the sd Sloopmen,
and the Bayles then on board the sd Ship to the number of Fourteen or
Fifteen, containing (as the Examinant supposeth) East India Goods,
were put out of the Ship into the sd Sloop, and the Examinant and sd
Brett also went onboard of her leaving the Ship in charge with James
Williams the Mate, and came up to Boston in the Sloop bringing in her
the aforementioned Bayles, and arrived there on a Monday night about
the latter end of September last past about Eight aclock in the
Evening, at the Wharffe on the backside of the Queen's head Inn, and
the Examinant went with sd Brett into the aforesaid Inn to procure a
Lodging for him and then went directly home to his own house; Saith he
knows not when or where the sd Bayles were put on shore nor how
disposed of, he signed no Bills of Ladeing nor receipt for them: And
Saith he knows neither the Sloop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span> nor men which brought them up;
Supposeth it to be a Sloop belonging to some Country Town lying on the
Sea Coast. Further the Examinant saith that the sd Brett was not
willing to have come with the sd Ship to New England but would have
gone to Carolina or East Jersey.</p>

is not precisely one of piracy, though piracy was at first suspected,
but rather of the receipt of piratical goods. Bellomont writes to the
Board of Trade, Oct. 24, 1699 (<i>Cal. St. P. Col.</i>, 1699, p. 486), that
he had lately seized at Boston a ship and some East India goods; that
the officers of the custom house were not nimble enough or they had
got all the goods, worth above &pound;2000; that that which first gave him a
"jealousy" of the ship was the fact that the master, William Sims, a
man formerly burnt in the hand for stealing, had gone forth a poor man
and come back master and half owner of a ship. The ship was seized,
condemned, and sold for the crown, and Sims committed to jail. He had
sailed as master of a sloop to Cura&ccedil;ao, and thence to Crab Island
(Vieques, see <a href="#DOC_72">doc. no. 72</a>, <a href="#Footnote_5_545">note 5</a>). <i>Ibid.</i>, 499. Bellomont suspected

and a Sloope of Six Guns: in all 4 pirates. Designing to get some good

Supposeing they had left them nothing to help themselves, for they
threw over Board a Spare topmast which lay upon the Deck, but by

<p><i>Excellent Sir</i></p>

<p>I have Enclosed sent you the Deposition of Wm. Fletcher, which I
suppose may be a more particular accot. then any your Excell'y may
receive. he ad's that the Pirates boasted much of their great strength
by sea, and that there were sufficient of them to repell any force
that would be sent against them, and used many enticements to perswade
his men to goe with them: and I Doubt it will be impossible to secure
the Navigation to and from this Country, and stop their Piraticall
Invations, without a greater force. Capt. Fletcher haveing lost his
Certificate, Cocquetts, and Register, cannot be entered and suffered
to Load without your Excellys order. the ship hath used this Place
many Years: and this Master in her last Year produced his
Certificates, Cocquets, and Register, all which are in my booke of
Entryes:<a name="FNanchor_2_706" id="FNanchor_2_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_706" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he hath the same Owners and [as?] the ships here. his
Townsmen will refitt him and hath his Loading and Tobacco ready: and
it would be severe if his misfortune should Doubly injure him. besides
it would prejudice his Majestys revenue to forbid him to Load,
therefore suppose if he gives Security to unload in England he may be
permitted to trade: if your Excellency think fitt. I lay wind bound
and [at (?)] Mr. Mekennies at Elizabeth River, and on Sunday last
afternoon we saw a ship come in: and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span> imediatly the <i>Shoreham</i> loosed
and went to turn out of the River, when we Crossing over to Castle
point<a name="FNanchor_3_707" id="FNanchor_3_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_707" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Mr. Makennie spoke with Capt. Passenger, who told him a Pirat
had pursued that ship and taken others and desired we would not
adventure into the Bay but lye at the Poynt. next morning early we saw
Cap. Passenger on the back of the horshooe,<a name="FNanchor_4_708" id="FNanchor_4_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_708" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> standing Down towards 3
ships in Lyn haven bay, who when he came up with them fired upon him,
and the Pyrate imediately gott to sail and stood directly with Capt.
Passenger, who got the weather gage, and Imediatly followed as sharp a
Dispute as (I thinke) could be betwixt two ships, of which we were
full spectators Dureing the whole engagement: and in my Judgment Capt.
Passenger behaved himself with much Courage and good Conduct, haveing
to Deal with an Enemy under a Desperate choice of killing or hanging,
and I believe few men in their circumstances but would elect the
first. the Conflict briskly maintained from soon after sunrise untill
about 4 afternoon. on thursday May the second Fletcher gott in here
and gave the inclosed accot.,<a name="FNanchor_5_709" id="FNanchor_5_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_709" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which I beleive much Imports his
Maj'tes service and Interest, least thinking the Pirate aforesaid
might be all, security would Endanger many ships. Fletcher further
saies these are not of them who tooke Burgis last Year but others, and
perhaps more may come upon the same accot. as these doe. I suppose
your Excelly will think fitt to lay on a Gen'll Embargoe untill some
Assureance that the Coast is Clear: and believe York River will be
more Convenient then James River, in Regard ships must goe to the Cape
to Clear the horshooe before they can gett into James River, and soe
may be Endangered. I wait your Excellys Order and Directions and
withall to favour me with a true relation of the success of the
Action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span> betwixt Capt. Passenger and the Pirate:<a name="FNanchor_6_710" id="FNanchor_6_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_710" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I humbly take leave

Col.</i>, 1700, p. 311. Governor Nicholson accompanied him in person,
aboard the <i>Shoreham</i>. During most of the fight the two ships were
within pistol-shot of each other. Finally the pirate, with all masts
and sails shattered, drifted aground. Then, having laid a train to
thirty barrels of gunpowder, he threatened to blow the ship up, and
the governor, to save the lives of the forty or fifty English
prisoners, gave quarter, promising to refer the pirates to the king's
mercy if they should surrender quietly. So 111 of them were sent to
England in the <i>Essex Prize</i> and the fleet of merchantmen convoyed by
her, June 9. The trial was of three who were brought in without having
been included in the surrender. It was held, in accordance with the
Virginian act, by a commission of oyer and terminer, appointed by the
governor. All three of them were hanged, although "One of them,
Cornelius Frank, said, Must I be hanged that can speake all
Languages"? Another curious passage in the trial deserves to be
quoted: "<i>Mr. Atty. Gen.</i> Did the Pyrates talk of blowing their Shipp
up? <i>Ed. Ashfeild.</i> Yes, they did, and went to prayers upon it." Nor
less the picture, in the evidence of either this or an adjoining
trial, of the pirate captain "with a gold chain around his neck, and a
gold Tooth-picker hanging from it"&mdash;<span xml:lang="fr"><i>nouveau riche</i></span>!</p></div>

<p><i>Sir</i></p>

<p>This Day 7 men which had been taken by a Pirate in a Pink without any
great Guns, only small Armes, and very litle Ammunition, came on shore
and informed us this News, which we thought convenient to Inform you,
that you may act according as the Necessity requires. Also Adam Hayes,
a man who lives on the Sea side, Informes us, he Yesterday saw a Pink
and Brigantine rideing at Anchor in sight of his house, 8 or 10 miles
to the soward of Cape Henry. the Brigantine he suppose came out of the
Capes. about 3 of the Clock in the afternoon he saw a boat goe from on
board the Brigantine, to the Pink. after that two boats were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span> Passing
and repassing from one vessel to the other till near night, at which
time the Pink weighed and stood of to sea. the Brigantine remained
there till within Night, but this morning Neither of them to be seen.
The abovesaid 7 men informed us the Pink which took them hath but 16
men which belonged to the Pyrate and 9 Prisoners. they say she
belonged (before taken) to Biddeford<a name="FNanchor_2_712" id="FNanchor_2_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_712" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and is an Extraordinary good
sailer. they also tell us they were put into a Boat and turned a
Drift, they think because they were to many to be kept on board, being
then 16 men Prisoners, and now as abovesaid but 9. likewise on tuesday
last they tooke a Bristol man and Cut down their Masts and Boltspritte
and left them as a wreck in the sea, as also another they tooke and
Cut a hole in her bottom and let her sink in the sea, and that they

made severall shots into the Pirates Shipp, and about one or two of
the Clock was by a shott from the Pirates shipp unhappily slaine.
about four in the afternoone the Pirate struck his bloody Collours and
hoisted up a flagg of truce and then fired no more Gunns, whereupon
Capt. Passenger Comanded a boat and hands to board the Pirate, who
brought back with them about 124 Pirates Prisoners, and it was
supposed there was about 25 or 30 kill'd in the fight and that about
40 or 50 English Prisoners were redeemed, whome the Pirate had taken.

adjudged Prize, Proceeds from a Commission for that purpose
particularly granted, under the Great Seale, to his Royall Highness.</p>

<p>And as to what may be most proper for the condemning of Prizes in
those parts, I humbly conceive it cannot be Regularly done, but by an
Authority grounded upon a Commission under the Broad Seale.</p>

<p>An Account of the Behaviour and Last Dying Speeches Of the Six
Pirates, that were Executed on Charles River, Boston side, on Fryday,
June 30th, 1704. <i>Viz.</i>, Capt. John Quelch, John Lambert, Christopher
Scudamore, John Miller, Erasmus Peterson and Peter Roach.</p>

<p><br />The Ministers of the Town had used more than ordinary Endeavours, to
Instruct the Prisoners, and bring them to Repentance. There were
Sermons Preached in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span> hearing, Every day,<a name="FNanchor_2_741" id="FNanchor_2_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_741" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And Prayers daily
made with them. And they were Catachised; and they had many occasional
Exhortations. And nothing was left, that could be done for their Good.</p>

<p>On Fryday the 20th [30th] of June 1704, Pursuant to Orders in the Dead
Warrant, the aforesaid Pirates were guarded from the Prison in Boston,
by Forty Musketeers, Constables of the Town, the Provost Marshal and
his Officers, etc. with Two Ministers,<a name="FNanchor_3_742" id="FNanchor_3_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_742" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who took great pains to
prepare them for the last Article of their Lives. Being allowed to
walk on Foot through the Town, to Scarlets Wharff,<a name="FNanchor_4_743" id="FNanchor_4_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_743" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> where, the
Silver Oar being carried before them, they went by Water to the place
of Execution, being Crowded and thronged on all sides with Multitudes
of Spectators. The Ministers then Spoke to the Malefactors, to this
Effect.</p>

<p>"We have told you often, ye[a] we have told you Weeping, That you have
by Sin undone your selves; That you were born Sinners, That you have
lived Sinners, That your Sins have been many and mighty, and that the
Sins for which you are now to Dy are of no common aggravation. We have
told you, That there is a Saviour for Sinners, and we have shewn you,
how to commit your selves into His Saving and Healing Hands. We have
told you, That if He Save you, He will give you an hearty Repentance
for all your Sins, and we have shown you how to Express that
Repentance. We have told you, What Marks of Life must be desired for
your Souls, that you may Safely appear before the Judgment Seat of
God. Oh! That the means used for your Good may by the Grace of God be
made Effectual. We can do no more, but leave you in His Merciful
Hands!"</p>

<p>When they were gone up upon the Stage, and Silence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span> was Commanded, One
of the Ministers Prayed, as followeth.</p>

<p>The Prayer made by One of the Ministers, after the Malefactors were
first upon the Stage.<a name="FNanchor_5_744" id="FNanchor_5_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_744" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (As near as it could be taken in Writing in
the great Crowd.)</p>

<p>"O Thou most Great and Glorious Lord! Thou art a Righteous, and a
Terrible God. It is a Righteous and an Holy Law that thou hast given
unto us. To break that Good Law, and Sin against thy Infinite Majesty,
can be no little Evil. Thy Word is always True; and very Particular,
that Word of thine which has told us and warn'd us, <i>Evil Pursueth
Sinners</i>. We have seen it, we have seen it; We have before our Eyes a
dreadful Demonstration of it. Oh! Sanctify unto us a Sight that has in
it so much of the Terror of the Lord! We have Reason to Glorify the
Free Grace of God, that we are not our selves the Instances. We have
before us very astonishing Examples of <i>Evil Pursuing Sinners</i>. Here
is a Number of men that have been very Great Sinners, and that are to
Dy before their Time, for their being wicked overmuch. God knows the
Prayers, the Pains, the Tears, and the Agonies that have been Employ'd
for them. And now, the Last Thing that we have to do for them, is to
pour out with Anguish of Soul our Prayer on their behalf; Our Prayer,
to that God, who heareth Prayer; to that God, with whom there is Mercy
and Plenteous Redemption; to that God, who is Rich in Mercy and Ready
to Pardon. But how can we make our Prayer, without a Rapturous
Adoration of that Free-Grace, which has distinguished us! We, even we
also, have every one of us an horrible Fountain of Sin in our Souls.
There are none of the Crimes committed by these Miserable Men, or by
the worst of those Criminals that go down into the Pit, but we have
the seeds of them, in that Original Corruption, which we brought into
the World with us. If God had left us to our selves, as He justly
might have done, there is not the best among us all, but what would
soon have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span> done the worst things in the World. Oh! The Free-Grace! Oh!
The Free-Grace! Oh! The Riches of that Grace, which has made all the
Difference! But now, we Cry mightily to Heaven, we Lift up our Cries
to the God of all Grace, for the Perishing Souls which are just now
going to Expire under the Stroke of Justice, before our Eyes. We
Mourn, we Mourn, that upon some of them, at Least, we do unto this
Minute see no better Symptomes. But, Oh! is there not yet a Room for
Sovereign Grace to be display'd, in their Conversion and Salvation!
They Perish, if they do not now Sincerely Turn from Sin to God, and
give themselves up to the Lord Jesus Christ; They Righteously and
Horribly Perish! And yet, without influences from above, they can do
none of those things which must be done if they do not perish. Oh! Let
us beg it of our God, that He would not be so Provoked at their
Multiplied and Prodigious Impieties, and at their obstinate Hardness
under means of Good formerly afforded them, as to withhold those
Influences from them! We cry to thee, O God of all Grace, That thou
wouldest not Suffer them to continue in the Gall of Bitterness and
Bond of Iniquity, and in the Possession of the Devil. Oh! Knock off
the Chains of Death which are upon their Souls; Oh! Snatch the prey
out of the Hands of the Terrible.</p>

<p>"Yet once again! Once again! We bring them, and lay them before the
Spirit of Grace. O Almighty Spirit of Grace, May these Poor, blind,
mad Sinners become objects for the Triumphs of Grace! O Almighty
Spirit of God, and of Grace, cause these poor men to see their own
Sinfulness and Wretchedness! Make them willing to be Saved from such
Sinfulness and Wretchedness; Discover to them the only Saviour of
their Souls. Oh! Dispose them, Oh! Assist them to give the Consent of
their Souls unto His Wonderful Proposals. Let them Dy, Renouncing all
Dependence on any Righteousness of their own; Alas, what can they have
of their own to Depend upon! As a Token and Effect of their having
Accepted the Righteousness of God, Let them heartily Repent of all
their Sins against thee, and Abhor and cast up every Morsel of their
Iniquity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span> Oh! Let them not go out of the World, raging and raving
against the Justice of God and Man; And whatever part of the Satanick
Image is yet remaining on their Souls, Oh! Efface it! Let them now Dy
in such a State and such a Frame, as may render them fit to appear
before God the Judge of all. What shall we do for them? What shall
plead for them?</p>

<p>"Great God, Grant that all the Spectators may get Good by the horrible
Spectacle that is now before them! Let all the People hear and fear,
and let no more any such Wickedness be done, as has produced this
woful Spectacle. And let all the People beware how they go on in the
Ways of Sin, and in the pathes of the Destroyer, after so Solemn
Warnings; Lest thou shouldest not only leave them to the grossest Acts
of Wickedness, but also give them up unto the most amazing
Impenitency, when the Punishment of their Iniquity comes to be
inflicted on them.</p>

<p>"Oh! but shall our Sea faring Tribe, on this Occasion, be in a
Singular manner affected with the Warnings of God! Lord, May those of
our dear Brethren be Saved from the Temptations which do so threaten
them! so ruine them! Oh! let them not Abandon themselves to Profanity,
to Swearing, to Cursing, to Drinking, to Leudness, to a cursed
Forgetfulness of their Maker, and of the End for which He made them!
Oh! Let them not be abandoned of God, unto those Courses that will
hasten them to a Damnation that slumbers not. Oh! Let the men fear the
Lord Exceedingly, We Pray thee! We Pray thee! Let the Condition of the
Six or Seven men, whom they now see Dying for their Wickedness upon
the Sea, be Sanctified unto them.</p>

<p>"And now, we fly, we fly to <i>Sovereign Grace</i>. Oh! that the Poor men,
which are immediately to appear before the awful Tribunal of God, may
first by <i>Sovereign Grace</i> have produced upon their Souls those Marks
of thy Favour, without which tis a dreadful Thing to appear before
that awful Tribunal. Oh! Great God, Let thy <i>Sovereign Grace</i> Operate
on this fearful Occasion! God be Merciful to us all, for the Sake of
our Lord Jesus Christ, unto whom with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span> the Father and the Spirit, be
ascribed the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory, for ever more, <i>Amen</i>."</p>

<p class="center">They then Severally Spoke, Viz.</p>

<p>I. <i>Capt. John Quelch.</i> The last Words he spake to One of the
Ministers at his going up the Stage, were, "I am not afraid of Death,
I am not afraid of the Gallows, but I am afraid of what follows; I am
afraid of a Great God, and a Judgment to Come." But he afterwards
seem'd to brave it out too much against that fear: also when on the
Stage first he pulled off his Hat, and bowed to the Spectators, and
not Concerned, nor behaving himself so much like a Dying man as some
would have done. The Ministers had, in the Way to his Execution, much
desired him to Glorify God at his Death, by bearing a due Testimony
against the Sins that had ruined him, and for the ways of Religion
which he had much neglected: yet now being called upon to speak what
he had to say, it was but thus much; "Gentlemen, 'Tis but little I
have to speak; What I have to say is this, I desire to be informed for
what I am here. I am Condemned only upon Circumstances. I forgive all
the World: So the Lord be Merciful to my Soul." When Lambert was
Warning the Spectators to beware of Bad-Company, Quelch joyning, "They
should also take care how they brought Money into New-England, to be
Hanged for it!"</p>

<p>II. <i>John Lambert.</i> He appeared much hardened, and pleaded much on his
Innocency. He desired all men to beware of Bad Company; he seem'd in a
great Agony near his Execution; he called much and frequently on
Christ, for Pardon of Sin, that God Almighty would Save his innocent
Soul; he desired to forgive all the World; his last words were, "Lord,
forgive my Soul! Oh, receive me into Eternity! blessed name of Christ
receive my Soul."</p>

<p>III. <i>Christopher Scudamore.</i> He appeared very Penitent since his
Condemnation, was very diligent to improve his time going to, and at
the place of Execution.</p>

<p>IV. <i>John Miller.</i> He seem'd much concerned, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span> complained of a
great Burden of Sins to answer for; Expressing often, "Lord! What
shall I do to be Saved!"</p>

<p>V. <i>Erasmus Peterson.</i> He cryed of injustice done him; and said, it is
very hard for so many mens Lives to be taken away for a little Gold.
He often said, his Peace was made with God; and his Soul would be with
God: yet extream hard to forgive those he said wronged him. He told
the Executioner, he was a strong man, and Prayed to be put out of
misery as soon as possible.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Peter Roach.</i> He seem'd little concerned, and said but little or
nothing at all.</p>

Repriev'd.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_740" id="Footnote_1_740"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_740">[1]</a> What is here reproduced, to show somewhat of the
harrowing circumstances under which the pirate's career might end, is
a very rare "extra" of the <i>Boston News-Letter</i>, found in the
Massachusetts Historical Society's file of that newspaper. The case of
Quelch and his associates is related in much detail by Mr. A.C.
Goodell in the <i>Acts and Resolves of the Province of Massachusetts
Bay</i>, VIII. 386-398, and in the <i>Publications</i> of the Colonial Society
of Massachusetts, III. 71-77. The pursuit of the pirates is described
in Sewall's diary, with extracts from the <i>News-Letter</i>, in Mass.
Hist. Soc., <i>Collections</i>, XLVI. 103-110. In August, 1703, the
brigantine <i>Charles</i>, fitted out as a privateer to cruise against the
French, was riding off Marblehead, with her captain lying too sick to
take her to sea. The crew seized the ship, put it in command of
Quelch, threw the captain overboard, and sailed for the coast of
Brazil, where for some months they engaged in a profitable career of
piracy at the expense of subjects of the King of Portugal, with whom
England had just concluded a particularly close alliance. In May,
1704, they reappeared on the Massachusetts coast, landed, and
dispersed, but were presently suspected, accused, proclaimed, and
"rounded up", the main capture being made at the Isles of Shoals, by
an armed force under Maj. Stephen Sewall, the diarist's brother. The
trial, June 13, 16, 19-21, was the first held in New England under the
act of Parliament 11 and 12 Will. III., ch. 7, which gave the crown
authority to issue commissions for the trial of pirates by specially
constituted courts, outside the realm of England. The governor, Joseph
Dudley, presided. Mr. Goodell maintains that the trial was conducted
illegally in important particulars. Of the six pirates named above, as
executed on June 30, Lambert was a Salem man, Peterson apparently a
Swede, Roach Irish, Quelch and the other two English. Judge Sewall
records that "When the Scaffold was let to sink, there was such a
Screech of the Women that my wife heard it sitting in our Entry next
the Orchard, and was much surprised at it; yet the wind was sou-west.
Our house is a full mile from the place." In 1835 the editor's
grandfather saw the six pirates of the <i>Mexican</i>, almost the last of
their profession, hanged at about the same spot. I find that Mr. Paine
has printed this piece, in <i>Buried Treasure</i>, but I know no other that
so well illustrates its particular aspect of our theme.</p></div>

Dudley was the governor's oldest son. The deposition is one of 55
enclosures in the governor's letter of Nov. 2, 1705, to the Board of
Trade respecting his complaints of irregularities in the governments
of Rhode Island and Connecticut. Though Dudley's commissions as
governor confined his civil authority to Massachusetts and New
Hampshire, his commission as vice-admiral (printed in the
<i>Publications</i> of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, II. 220-224)
gave him authority in Rhode Island also. The assembly of that colony,
however, claimed the right under their charter to erect admiralty
courts of their own, and for their governor the right to commission
privateers. Queen Anne wrote to them in March 1704, repealing their
act erecting a court, but they held that her letter did not forbid the
commissioning of privateers. See <i>Records of the Colony of Rhode
Island</i>, III. 508-510, 535-540.</p></div>

South Carolina, vol. A-B. The document is spread upon the records of
the court for Nov. 27, 1716, at the beginning of the day's
proceedings. This commission is a peculiar one. As has been explained
in <a href="#Footnote_2_386">note 2</a> to <a href="#DOC_51">doc. no. 51</a> and in <a href="#Footnote_1_740">note 1</a> to <a href="#DOC_104">doc. no. 104</a>, the act 28
Henr. VIII. ch. 15 (1536) provided for the trial of piracy by
commissions specially appointed for the purpose, and with a jury, but
did not extend to the oversea plantations, while the act 11 and 12
Will. III. ch. 7 (1699-1700) extended to those dominions the crown's
authority to appoint such commissions. Before the passage of the
latter statute, colonial governors had as vice-admirals appointed such
commissions, which had then proceeded under the civil (Roman) law, and
not under the statute. But South Carolina had in 1712 expressly
adopted the act of 28 Henr. VIII. (Cooper, <i>Statutes at Large</i>, II.
470) and here we have a commission issued by the deputy governor and
council, under authority of the proprietors of Carolina, for trial
under the act of 1536, though action could have been taken under that
of 1700. The accused persons for whose trial the commission was issued
were acquitted. For the whole subject of piracy in or near Carolina,
where it was rife in these years, see S.C. Hughson, "The Carolina
Pirates and Colonial Commerce", in <i>Johns Hopkins University Studies</i>,
XII. The most famous case was that of Major Stede Bonnet, but the
original records of that case are fully printed in <i>State Trials</i>, ed.

was a notable sea-captain and pilot. For a number of years he
commanded the naval vessel of Massachusetts, so that it was the
natural course for the governor to send him in pursuit of pirates who
suddenly appeared on the Massachusetts coast. In 1711 he had commanded
a vessel in the unfortunate expedition against Quebec under Sir
Hovenden Walker, and the admiral had stayed at his house during his
long detention in Boston. He was also the most noted map-maker of his
time in New England; in 1694 King William had admitted him to kiss his
hands and had given him a gold chain of &pound;50 for his map of
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the St. Lawrence region (<i>Acts. P.C.
Col.</i>, II. 264). The governor whom he addresses was Samuel Shute,
governor 1716-1727. The ending of the War of the Spanish Succession
(1713) had as usual caused a large revival of piracy, many privateers
turning to that trade. The career of the <i>Whidah</i> and of Capt. Samuel
Bellamy can be made out from the depositions which follow. On April
26, in a heavy gale, she had come ashore on the sands of Cape Cod, in
what is now Wellfleet, and all on board but two men (see <a href="#DOC_114">doc. no. 114</a>)
were drowned. More than a hundred of the pirates thus perished. Of
those who escaped wreck, in the smaller vessels, several, who had
constituted the prize crew of the <i>Mary Anne</i> (<a href="#DOC_109">doc. no. 109</a>), were
captured, tried, and executed (<a href="#DOC_112">doc. no. 112</a>). The story is told in
<i>The Trials of Eight Persons Indited for Piracy</i>, etc. (Boston, 1718),
and by Mr. John H. Edmonds in the <i>Boston Sunday Globe</i> for Oct. 22,
1916.</p></div>

him safely into Cape Cod Harbor, purposely "approached so near the
land, that the pirate's large ship which followed him struck on the

there are King William and Queen Mary's coppers picked up, and pieces
of silver, called cob money [see <a href="#DOC_62">doc. no. 62</a>, <a href="#Footnote_15_443">note 15</a>]. The violence
of the seas moves the sands upon the outer bar so that at times the
iron caboose of the ship, at low ebbs, has been seen." <i>Ubi sup.</i> In
1863 she was quite visible. Another reporter tells us that "For many
years after this shipwreck, a man of a very singular and frightful
aspect used every spring and autumn to be seen travelling on the Cape,
who was supposed to have been one of Bellamy's crew. The presumption
is that he went to some place where money had been secreted by the
pirates, to get such a supply as his exigencies required. When he
died, many pieces of gold were found in a girdle which he constantly
wore." Thoreau, <i>Cape Cod</i>, ed. 1914, p. 192. On one of Southack's
maps, a narrow waterway across Cape Cod is marked with the legend,
"The Place where I came through with a Whale Boat, being ordered by
the Governm't to look after the Pirate Ship <i>Whido</i>, Bellame
Command'r, cast away the 26 of April, 1717, where I buried One Hundred
and Two Men Drowned". This map, with this legend, is reproduced at the
back of Miss Mary R. Bangs's <i>Old Cape Cod</i> (Boston, 1920). The
western initial portion of this waterway still exists, in the town of
Orleans, and is known as "Jeremiah's Gutter". See A.P. Brigham, <i>Cape

<p>The Substance of the Examinations of John Brown, etc. Taken by order
of His Excellency the Governour on Munday the 6th of May 1717.</p>

<p>John Brown being interrogated saith, that he was born in the Island of
Jamaica, is 25 years old and unmarried. About a year agoe he belonged
to a Ship commanded by Captain Kingston, which in her voyage with
Logwood to Holland was taken to the Leeward of the Havana by two
Piratical Sloops, one commanded by Hornygold<a name="FNanchor_2_772" id="FNanchor_2_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_772" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the other by a
Frenchman called Leboose,<a name="FNanchor_3_773" id="FNanchor_3_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_773" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> each having 70 men on board. The pirats
kept the Ship about 8 or 10 daies, and then having taken out off her
what they thought proper delivered her back to some of the men, who
belonged to her. Leboose kept the Examinate on board his Sloop about 4
months, the English Sloop under Hornigolds command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span> keeping company
with them all that time. Off Cape Corante<a name="FNanchor_4_774" id="FNanchor_4_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_774" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> they took two Spanish
Briganteens without any resistance, laden with cocoa from Ma[l]aca.
The Spaniards, not coming up to the pirats demand about the ransom,
were put ashoar and their Briganteens burn'd. They sailled next to the
Isle of Pines, where meeting with three or four English Sloops empty,
they made use of them in cleaning their own, and gave them back. From
thence they sailled in the latter end of May to Hispaniola, where they
tarried about 3 months. The Examinate then left Leboose and went on
board the Sloop commanded formerly by Hornygold, but at that time by
one Bellamy, who upon a difference arising amongst the English Pirats
because Hornygold refused to take and plunder English Vessels, was
chosen by a great majority their Captain, and Hornygold departed with
26 hands in a Prize Sloop, Bellamy having then on board about 90 men,
most of them English. Bellamy and Leboose sailled to the Virgin
Islands and took several small fishing boats, and off St. Croix a
French Ship laden with flower and fish from Canada, and having taken
out some of the flower gave back the Ship. Plying to the Windward the
morning they made Saba<a name="FNanchor_5_775" id="FNanchor_5_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_775" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> they spy'd two Ships, which they chased and
came up with, the one was commanded by Captain Richards,<a name="FNanchor_6_776" id="FNanchor_6_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_776" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the other
by Capt. Tosor, both bound to the bay. Having plunder'd the Ships and
taken out some young men, they dismist the rest and Tosors Ship and
made a man of War of Richards's, which they put under the command of
Bellamy, and appointed Paull Williams Captain of the Sloop. Next day
they took a Bristol Ship<a name="FNanchor_7_777" id="FNanchor_7_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_777" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> commanded by James Williams from Ireland
laden with provisions, and having taken out what provisions they
wanted and two or three of the Crew let her goe. Then they parted with
their French consort at the Island of Blanco<a name="FNanchor_8_778" id="FNanchor_8_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_778" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and stood away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span> with
their Ship and Sloop to the windward passage, where in the latter end
of February last they met with Captain Laurence Prince in a ship of
300 Ton called the <i>Whido</i>, with 18 guns mounted, and fifty men, bound
from Jamaica to London, laden with Sugar, Indico, Jesuits bark and
some silver and gold, and having given chase thre daies took him
without any other resistance than his firing two chase guns at the
Sloop, and came to an anchor at Long Island.<a name="FNanchor_9_779" id="FNanchor_9_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_779" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Bellamy's crew and
Williams's consisted then of 120 men. They gave the Ship taken from
Captain Richards to Captain Prince, and loaded her with as much of the
best and finest goods as she could carry, and gave Captain Prince
above twenty pounds in Silver and gold to bear his charges. They took
8 or 10 men belonging to Captain Prince; the Boatswain and two more
were forced, the rest being volunteers. off Petteguavis<a name="FNanchor_10_780" id="FNanchor_10_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_780" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> they took
an English Ship hired by the French, laden with Sugar and Indico, and
having taken out what they had occasion for, and some of the men,
dismist her. Then they stood away for the Capes of Virginia, being 130
men in Company, and having lost sight of the Sloop the day before they
made the land, they cruised ten daies, according to agreement between
Bellamy and Williams, in which time they seized three ships and one
Snow, Two of them from Scotland, one from Bristol, and the fourth a
Scotch Ship, last from Barbadoes, with a little Rum and Sugar on
board, so leaky that the men refused to proceed further. The Pirats
sunk her. Having lost the Sloop they kept the Snow, which was taken
from one Montgomery, being about 100 Ton, and manned her with 18
hands, which with her own Crew made up the number of 28 men; the other
two Ships were discharged being first plundered. They made<a name="FNanchor_11_781" id="FNanchor_11_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_781" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The Deposition of Thomas Fitz Gerald, Marriner, aged about nineteen
years, and late Mate of the Pink <i>Mary Anne</i>, belonging to Dublin
(whereof Andrew Crumsty was lately Commander) and Alexander
Mackconothy late Cook of the said Pink, aged fifty five years.</p>

<p>These Depon'ts Testify and say That on the twenty fourth day of April
last past, they sailed from Nantasket harbour bound for New York, and
on the twenty sixth day of the said month, being friday, in the
morning about nine of the clock, they discovered a large Ship, and her
Prize, which was a Snow, astern, and the large Ship came up with the
said Pink <i>Mary Ann</i>, between nine and ten, and ordered us to strike
our Colours, which accordingly we did, and then they shot ahead of us,
and braced too, and hoisted out her boat and sent seven Men on board,
Armed with their Musquets, pistols and Cutlashes (which Men are now in
Boston Goal) and they commanded the said Capt. Crumpsty to take his
Papers, and go aboard the said Ship with five of his hands and
accordingly the said Crumpsty with five of his Men rowed aboard the
said Pyrates Ship, and the seven Men tarryed aboard the Pink, and soon
after the Pyrates sent their boat on board the said pink with four
hands to get some of the Wine which they were Informed was on board
the Pink, and accordingly they hoisted the pinks boat off of the
hatches and opened the hatches and then went into the hold, but the
Cable being Quoiled in the hatchway, they found it difficult to Come
to the Wines in the hold, and so returned to their own Ship without
any wine, Except five bottles of green wine which the found in the
pinks Cabbin and carryed away, with some of the Cloaths which belonged
to the pinks Company, and presently after the pyrates had hoisted
their boat on board the great Ship, they gave Orders to the Pyrates on
board the pink to steer North Northwest after them, which Course they
followed till about four a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span> Clock in the afternoon, and then the large
Ship whereof Capt. Samuel Bellame was Commander, and the snow and pink
lay too,<a name="FNanchor_2_783" id="FNanchor_2_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_783" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it being very thick foggy weather, And about half an hour
after four a Clock a sloop came up with Capt. Bellames Ship and he
hoisted out his boat and sent several men on board the Sloop and soon
afterwards, Vizt. about five a Clock, the Commander of the snow bore
away, and came under the stern of Capt. Bellames Ship and told him
that they saw the Land; And thereupon Capt. Bellame Ordered the
Pyrates on board the Pink to steer away North, which they did, and as
soon as it began to be dark the sd Capt. Bellames Ship put out a light
astern and also the snow and the sloop and the pink had their lights
out; and about ten a Clock the weather grew thick and it lightned and
rained hard and was so dark, that the pinks Comp. Could not see the
shore till they were among the Breakers, when the Depon't Fitz Gerald
was at helm, and had lost sight of the Great Ship, Snow and Sloop; and
being among the breakers we thought it most proper and necessary to
weere<a name="FNanchor_3_784" id="FNanchor_3_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_784" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the Pink, and before we could trim the head sails we run
ashoar opposite to Sluts bush at the back of Stage harbour to the
southward of Cape Codd<a name="FNanchor_4_785" id="FNanchor_4_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_785" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> between ten and Eleven a Clock at night, And
the seven Pyrates together with the Depon't and a young man named
James Donovan tarryed on board the said Pink till break of day<a name="FNanchor_5_786" id="FNanchor_5_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_786" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and
then found the shoar side of the Pink dry and so all of them went on
shoar upon the Island called Poachy<a name="FNanchor_6_787" id="FNanchor_6_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_787" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> beach, and there tar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>ryed till
about ten a Clock, when two Men came over in a Canno, Namely John
Cole<a name="FNanchor_7_788" id="FNanchor_7_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_788" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and William Smith, who Carryed the seven pyrates over to the
Main land, and then Cole came again to the Depon't and Inquired who
they (meaning the pyrates) were, and the Depon't Mackconothy Answered
they were pyrates and had taken the said pink, and soon after the said
John Cole Informed Mr. Justice Done of Barnstable<a name="FNanchor_8_789" id="FNanchor_8_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_789" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> thereof, by
virtue of whose Warrant the said seven Pyrates were Apprehended, and
the Depon'ts Journeyed with them to Boston, where they are now in
Custody of the Keeper of His Maj'ties Goal as is aforesaid. And
further the Depon'ts say not; but that the said Pink is Bilged on
shoare, so that it is impossible to get her off.</p>

with berry-bushes, in the midst of the large isle of Nauset, that lay
outside of the smaller Pochet Island and outside Stage or Nauset
Harbor, the harbor of Eastham. Now, Slut's Bush ledge and Nauset
Island are far out from the present shore and under deep water. On
this mostly sandy coast wind and wave have made extraordinary changes.

<p>We, Ralph Merry and Samuel Roberts, mariners, both of full age,
Joyntly and Severally testify and make Oath That on the twenty sixth
day of April last we belonged to a certain Sloope Called the <i>Fisher</i>
(whereof Robert Ingols was Commander), bound to Boston from Virginia,
being laden with Tobacco, hides and other things. That Assoon as we
arived within a few leagues off Cape Codd we met with a Ship of twenty
eight guns called the <i>Wedaw</i>, which assoon as they came near, haled
us and Demanded from whence we came. We told 'em That we came from
Virginia and were bound for Boston. Then they asked us whether the
Master was Acquainted here, meaning (as we suppose) with the Coast.
Our Master Answered he knew it very well, Whereupon they Commanded our
Master and Company to hoist out our boat, which we did, and then our
Master and Mate went on board the said Ship. they, keeping our Master
and Mate on board thereof, Sent four men Armed from thence on board of
our Sloop, whereupon the said Ship stood away to the Northward and
gave Orders to our Sloope to follow their Light, And being in the
Night we lost Sight of said Ship And followed a Snowe light which was
before in Company with her (which said Snow was a Prize the said Ship
had taken off from the Capes of Virginia, as we were informed) untill
the Snow was almost ashoar. then the said Snow came to an Anchor And
Called to us to doe the same, which we Accordingly did, and lay there
till about ten of the Clock the next day, being the twenty Seventh day
of said month; then, the wind blowing off Shoar, they Cutt their Cable
and bid us make the best of our way after them to the Eastward, and
About three leagues off the Cape they, taking out of our Sloope what
they pleased, Commanded us to goe on board the said Snow. then they,
Cutting our Mast off by the board, the hatches of our Sloope being
open, left her afloat in the Sea, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span> makeing the best of their way
to Menhagen<a name="FNanchor_2_801" id="FNanchor_2_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_801" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> at the Eastward, where we arrived the twenty ninth of
said April, where they stayed and waited for the aforesaid Ship
<i>Wedaw</i> Some time, but she came not, whereupon, thinking the Ship was
lost, they fitted their Long boat and sent her down to Mentinacus,<a name="FNanchor_3_802" id="FNanchor_3_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_802" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
where they tooke a Sloope belonging to Colonel Minot,<a name="FNanchor_4_803" id="FNanchor_4_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_803" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> one Shallop
belonging to Capt. Lane,<a name="FNanchor_5_804" id="FNanchor_5_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_804" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and three Scooners. They brought the Sloop
and Shallop and (as we are Informed) the Sailes and Compasses of the
three Scooners to Menhagen, whereupon they manned the last mentioned
Sloope with ten hands and soe went after Capt. Cars Sloope, lying at
Peniquid,<a name="FNanchor_6_805" id="FNanchor_6_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_805" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which they alsoe took a little distance from said
Peniquid, but finding the Mast and Bowspreat not Serviceable they left
her there, and brought the Master thereof on board the Snow then at
Menhagen aforesaid. In these ten mens absence Came into Menhagen two
Shallops from Marblehead, which the Snow tooke and Caused 'em to come
to an Anchor there, and sent the men therein togeather With us the
Depon'ts to prison upon Menhagen Island, where we lay till they had
fitted the Sloop of Collonel Minots aforesaid with what they thought
fit from the Snow, and soe departed and left the Snow and all the rest
behind,<a name="FNanchor_7_806" id="FNanchor_7_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_806" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and leaving us to our Libertyes ordered the Skipper of the

Defence, Then demanded what they had to say for themselves.</p>

<p>Simon Van Vorst Alledged that he was forced by Capt. Bellamys Company
to Do what he did, and would have mad known his Intentions to make his
Escape from the Pyrates unto the Mate of the sd Pink, but that he
understood by the Mates Discourse that he Inclined to be a Pyrate

no Evidence to make it Appear to the Court.</p>

and the Governour of that place seemed to favour his Design, till
Capt. Bellamy and his Company sent the Governour word that they would
burn and destroy the Town, if that the sd Baker and those that
Concealed themselves with him were not delivered up, And afterwards he
would have made his Escape at Crabb Island<a name="FNanchor_6_812" id="FNanchor_6_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_812" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but was hindred by four

the French Vessel which they took him in, But the Commander thereof
soon after dyed and so Captn. Bellamy would not permit him to proceed
the sd. Voyage and he was unavoidably forced to Continue among the
Pyrates.</p>

<p>Peter Cornelius Hoof Declares and Saith That he was taken by Capt.
Bellamy in a Vessel whereof John Cornelius was Master, That the sd.

the Instance of Capt. Bellamy's Doctor, who advised him to stay with
him till his Cure. And that when he went on board the Pink <i>Mary Anne</i>
he did not Carry any Arms with him; and that he hoped by going on
board the Pink he should the sooner make his Escape from the Pyrates,
for that he had a better way of getting his Living than by Pyrating.</p>

22 Van Vorst, Brown, Quintor, Hoof, Shuan, and Baker were condemned
and sentenced to death. Cotton Mather records in his <i>Diary</i>, II. 483,
that on Nov. 2 he had obtained a reprieve, perhaps a pardon, for one
who was more penitent and less guilty than the others (South or Davis?
but both had been acquitted). On Nov. 15 he records, II. 488, "Six
pirates executed. I took a long and sad Walk with them, from the
Prison to the Place of Execution", instructed them, and prayed with
them. Before the end of the year he published <i>Instructions to the

<p>Then the Kings Evidences were called into Court and, no Objection agt
them being made by the Prisoner,</p>

<p>Owen Morris, Marriner, was first Examined upon Oath, Who solemnly
Testifyed and Declared that he knew the Prisoner at the Barr, That he
belonged to the Ship <i>St. Michael</i>, whereof James Williams was Master,
and in the Month of September 1716 They left Bristol bound to Jamaica
and in December following the said Ship was taken by two Pyrat Sloops,
one comanded by Capt. Samuel Bellamy, and the other by Louis Le Boose,
about Twenty Leagues off Sabia,<a name="FNanchor_2_817" id="FNanchor_2_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_817" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That they Gave the said Williams
his Ship and Detained the Prisoner, because he was a Carpenter and a
Singleman, together with Three others of the Ships Company. And
further the Dep't Saith that the Prisoner was very Unwilling to goe
with Bellamy and prevailed with him by reason of his Intreatys to
promise that he should be Discharged the next Vessell that was taken,
and afterwards the Dep't was again taken in the Ship <i>Whido</i>,
Commanded by Capt. Prince, by the said Captain Bellamy, who was then
Commander of the Ship <i>Sultana</i>, taken from Capt. Richards as the
Dep't understood, and then he saw the Pris'r aboard the said Ship. At
which time the Pris'r reminded the said Bellamy of his promise. When
he asked him if he was willing to goe he answered, yes, and then the
said Capt. Bellamy replyed if the Company would Consent he should go.
And thereupon he asked his Comp'y if they were willing to lett Davis
the Carpenter go, Who Expressed themselves in a Violent manner saying
no, Dam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span> him, they would first shoot him or Whip him to Death at the
Mast.</p>

<p>Thomas South, Marriner, lately taken by Capt. Samuel Bellamy in the
Pyrate Ship <i>Whido</i>, Cast away upon this Coast, and Discharged upon
his Tryal, was admitted an Evidence, and being Accordingly Sworn
Saith; That the said Bellamy while he was in Command of the said Ship
<i>Whido</i> took a Scotch Vessel off the Capes of Virginia last Spring,
Cutt down her Masts and Sunk her. That he heard the said Thomas Davis
went on Board her: but I did not see him. That this Depo't Thought it
not prudent to be too familiar with the Prisoner<a name="FNanchor_3_818" id="FNanchor_3_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_818" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> because it might
tend to Create a Jealousy in the Pyrates, that the Depo't and the
Pris'r (whom they Suspected, because he was a forced man) would runn
away together, and The Depo't Saith further that Capt. James Williams,
Commander of the Ship <i>St. Michael</i> (whose Carpenter the Pris'r was)
Intreated the said Capt. Bellamy when he took him to lett the Pris'r
go. But the Ships Comp'y would by no means Consent thereto by reason
he was a Carpenter, And swore that they would shoot him before they
would lett him go from them.</p>

<p>Capt. John Brett, Marriner, Sworn, Saith that he was taken by Capt.
Samuel Bellamy before the Ship <i>Sultania</i> was taken from Capt.
Richards, and then it was the Custome among the Pyrates to force no
Prisoners, but those that remained with them were Voluntiers.</p>

<p>Capt. Thomas Fox, sworn, saith that he was taken by the Pyrates in
July last and Robb'd, and they Questioned him whether anything was
done to the Pyrates in Boston Goall. The Depo't Answered he knew
nothing about them, and in particular a Dutchman belonging to the
Pyrate asked him about his Consort, a Dutch Man, in Boston Prison, and
said that if the Prisoners Suffered they would Kill every Body they
took belonging to New England.</p>

<p>Seth Smith, Prison keeper in Boston, sworn, Saith that when the
Prisoner at the Barr was first brought to Goal his Illness hindered
their talking together, But sometime after as they were discoursing
the Depo't observed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span> Prisoner that if he would be Ingenious and
make a Confession he might save his Life and be a good Evidance
against the other Pyrates in Prison, To which the Prisoner made answer
that he was abused by Several of the Pyrates that were Drowned and was
Glad he had got from them, but knew nothing against the Rest of the
Pyrates in Prison.</p>

<p>Then the Kings Council moved the Court that Capt. Thomas Glyn, a
Prisoner for Debt upon Execution, might be brought into Court to give
Evidence on his Majestys behalf in this Tryal, Whereupon the Court
directed the Sheriffs who have the keeping of his Majestys Goal to
bring the said Glyn into Court.</p>

<p>Capt. Isaac Morris, Sworn, Saith That on the 14th of September 1716 he
was taken by the Pyrates but knows nothing of Capt. Bellamy or his
accomplices.</p>

<p>Capt. Thomas Glyn, being brought into Court by the Sheriffs and
Interrogated upon Oath, Saith that he never knew the Prisoner.</p>

<p>The Memorial and humble Representation of Thomas Davis of Bristol in
Great Britain, Shipwright,</p>

<p>Sheweth, That in the month of September last past he sailed out of
Bristol as Carpenter of the Ship <i>St. Michael</i>, whereof James Williams
was the Commander, bound for Jamaica, and on or about the sixteenth
day of December following We met two Pyrate Sloops, One Commanded by
Capt Samuel Bellame, and the other by Monsr. Louis Le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span> Bou[s], who
took the said ship about twenty Leagues off of Sabia and Carried us to
the Island of Blanco, w[h]ere we were kept till the ninth day of
January when your Memo. (with about fourteen more Prisoners taken by
the said Pyrate Sloope) was forced on board the ship <i>Sultan Gally</i>,
taken from Capt. John Richards, then under the said Bellames Command,
And afterwards the said Bellame took another ship called the <i>Whiddo</i>,
and your Memo., with the rest of the said Ships Compa., Came in her
upon this Coast, where she was Cast away, as is very well known, and
your Memo, (with one Jno. Julian<a name="FNanchor_2_820" id="FNanchor_2_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_820" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>) only Escaped. And since his
Imprisonm't he is Informed That some have Reported That your Memo. was
several times on board the said ship after she was Cast away and knew
where a considerable part of her Treasure was, and that he had
Concealed some of it;<a name="FNanchor_3_821" id="FNanchor_3_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_821" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and many other things have been given out
Concerning your Memo. very falsely, to the great prejudice of your
Memo., Who is altogether Ignorant of what is Alledged against him, And
hath already Discharged his Conscience by making a true and full
Discovery of all he knows referring to the premises. But your Memo.
being a stranger was not Credited and therefore he had no better Fare
than the Pyrates, being in Chains as well as they; Whereas he declares
from his heart that he was forced along with them, very Contrary to
his will and to his great grief and sorrow, and was no ways Active
among them any further than he was Compelled.</p>

<p>And forasmuch as your Memo. understands that the Pyrates in Prison
suspect that he will make such discoverys as will not be pleasing to
them, he is fearfull least they should hurt him, if not deprive him of
life, to prevent his Testimony against them. Your Memo. therefore and
for the Considerations before mentioned Humbly prays your Excellency
and Honours will so far Indulge him as to free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span> him from his Chains
and Imprisonm't with the pyrates, and that he may have some Apartm't
seperate from them, and that such other Relief may be Given to your
poor pet'r (who is Innocent of what is laid to his Charge) as the
matter will bear, and as to your Excellency and Honours in your great
Moderation and Compassion shall seem meet.</p>

<p>And your Memo. (as in Duty bound) shall ever pray, etc.</p>

<p>To His Excellency the Governour and Council</p>

<p>The humble Petition of William Davis of Bristol Carpenter and Father

<p><i>Sir</i>,</p>

<p>Since I had the Honour of your letter I have looked into the Registers
Office,<a name="FNanchor_2_824" id="FNanchor_2_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_824" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and there find Copies of the Orders of Council, of
Commissions for granting Letters of Mart, of Commissions for
proceeding in Prize Courts, and of Warrants to the Judge of the High
Court of Admiralty thereupon, in the years 1664, 1672, 1689 and
1702,<a name="FNanchor_3_825" id="FNanchor_3_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_825" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of which if you please you may have Copies if they will be of
any service in the present Case.</p>

<p>Now as to the Question proposed whether there is Occasion for any
further power, to the severall Courts of Admiralty in the plantations,
other Remote parts, or at home, to Try and Condemn such Prizes as may
be Taken?</p>

<p>As far as I have observed during the course of the Wars with Holland,
France and Spain, the High Court of Admiralty have proceeded in all
Prize causes, by Virtue of Warrants from the Lord High Admiral or
Commissioners for Executing that Office, in pursuance of Commissions
under the Great Seal directed to them for that purpose;<a name="FNanchor_4_826" id="FNanchor_4_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_826" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
Commissioners were appointed at the severall Plantations to take the
Examinations of Witnesses in preparatory and to transmit them hither,
together with the Ships papers, and in case the ship and Goods were
perishable they had a Power to Appraise and sell, and keep the produce
in their hands, till after Sentence, that the Merchants might have
time, and be at a Certainty, where to enter their Claims.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<p>But after the American Act, the Vice-Admiralty Courts in the
Plantations, by Authority thereof,<a name="FNanchor_5_827" id="FNanchor_5_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_827" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> proceeded in Prize Causes, which
I conceive they had no right to do before; and that power being during
the late War only, by Virtue of that Act, I presume it is now
determined. Therefore upon a Grant of new Powers, I must humbly submit
it to their Lordships Consideration, whether it may be for the Honour
and Service of his Majesty, to permit the Vice-Admiralty Courts in the
Plantations to proceed in Prize Causes, since it is much to be feared
they are not well versed in the Laws of Nations, and Treaties between
Us and other States; and it is well known that they do not proceed in
that Regular Manner as is practised in His Majesties High Court of
Admiralty; besides it will be a Considerable Time before Orders from
their Lordships upon any Emergency can reach the Vice Admiralty Courts
in the plantations, for want of which great Inconveniences may arise;
whereas the Admiralty Court here is under their Lordships Eye and
Immediate direction, and always ready to observe such Instructions as
the Nature of affairs shall require.</p>

<p>But this is most humbly submitted to Their Lordships great Wisdom, by,
Sir,</p>

<p><i>Boston</i>, On Monday last, the 15th Currant, arrived here the Ship
<i>Samuel</i>, about eleven Weeks from London, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span> ten from Lands end,
Capt. Samuel Carry Commander,<a name="FNanchor_2_829" id="FNanchor_2_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_829" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who in his Voyage hither, on the 13th
of July past, in the Latitude of 44, about 30 or 40 Leagues to the
Eastward of the Banks of New-foundland, was accosted and taken by two
Pirates, viz., A Ship of 26 Guns, and a Sloop of ten, both Commanded
by Capt. Thomas Roberts,<a name="FNanchor_3_830" id="FNanchor_3_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_830" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> having on board about a hundred Men, all
English: The dismal Account whereof follows:</p>

<p>The first thing the Pirates did, was to strip both Passengers and
Seamen of all their Money and Cloths which they had on board, with a
loaded Pistol held to every ones breast ready to shoot him down, who
did not immediately give an account of both, and resign them up. The
next thing they did was, with madness and rage to tare up the Hatches,
enter the Hould like a parcel of Furies, where with Axes, Cutlashes,
etc., they cut, tore and broke open Trunks, Boxes, Cases and Bales,
and when any of the Goods came upon Deck which they did not like to
carry with them aboard their Ship, instead of tossing them into the
Hould again they threw them over-board into the Sea. The usual method
they had to open Chests was by shooting a brace of Bullets with a
Pistol into the Key-hole to force them open. The Pirates carryed away
from Capt. Carry's Ship aboard their own 40 barrels of Powder, two
great Guns, his Cables, etc. and to the value of about nine or ten
Thousand Pounds Sterling worth of the Choicest Goods he had on board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
There was nothing heard among the Pirates all the while, but Cursing,
Swearing, Dam'ing and Blaspheming to the greatest degree imaginable,
and often saying they would not go to Hope point<a name="FNanchor_4_831" id="FNanchor_4_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_831" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in the River of
Thames to be hung up in Gibbets a Sundrying as Kidd and Bradish's
Company did, for if it should chance that they should be Attacked by
any Superiour power or force, which they could not master, they would
immediately put fire with one of their Pistols to their Powder, and go
all merrily to Hell together! They often ridicul'd and made a mock at
King George's Acts of Grace<a name="FNanchor_5_832" id="FNanchor_5_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_832" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> with an Oath, that they had not got
Money enough, but when they had, if he then did grant them one, after
they sent him word, they would thank him for it. They forced and took
away with them Capt. Carry's Mate, and his Seamen, viz. Henry Gilespy,
Mate,<a name="FNanchor_6_833" id="FNanchor_6_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_833" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Hugh Minnens,<a name="FNanchor_7_834" id="FNanchor_7_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_834" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> both North Britains, Michael Le Couter, a
Jersey Man, and Abraham, a Kentish Man, could not learn his Sir-name,

which they would not take because born in Ireland),<a name="FNanchor_8_835" id="FNanchor_8_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_835" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> holding a
Pistol with a brace of Bullets to each of their breasts to go with
them, or be presently shot down, telling them that at present they
wanted none of their Service; but when they came to any Action, they
should have liberty to Fight and Defend the Ship as they did, or else
immediately be shot, that they should not tell tales. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span> had on
board the Pirate near 20 Tuns of Brandy. However the Pirates made
themselves very merry aboard of Capt. Carry's Ship with some Hampers
of fine Wines that were either presents, or sent to some Gentlemen in
Boston; it seems they would not wait to unty them and pull out the
Corks with Skrews, but each man took his bottle and with his Cutlash
cut off the Neck and put it to their Mouths and drank it out.<a name="FNanchor_9_836" id="FNanchor_9_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_836" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Whilst the Pirates were disputing whither to sink or burn Capt.
Carry's Ship they spy'd a Sail that same evening, and so let him go
free.</p>

<p>And at Midnight they came up with the same, which was a Snow from
Bristol, Capt. Bowls Master, bound for Boston, of whom they made a
Prize, and serv'd him as they did Capt. Carry, unloaded his Vessel and
forced all his Men, designing to carry the Snow with them to make her
a Hulk to carreen their Ship with.</p>

<p>The abovesaid Capt. Roberts in Novemb. 1718,<a name="FNanchor_10_837" id="FNanchor_10_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_837" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was third Mate of a
Guinea Man out of London for Guinea, Capt. Plummer Commander, who was
taken by a Pirate, and by that means Roberts himself became a Pirate,
and being an active, brisk Man, they voted him their Captain, which he
readily embraced.</p>

<p>The said Roberts in the abovesaid Sloop, Rhode Island built, with a
Briganteen Consort Pirate, was some time in January last in the
Latitude of Barbadoes, near the Island, where they took and
endeavoured to take several Vessels; but the Governour,<a name="FNanchor_11_838" id="FNanchor_11_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_838" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> hearing of
it, fitted out one Capt. Rogers of Bristol, in a fine Gally, a Ship of
about 20 Guns, and a Sloop, Capt. Graves Commander; Capt. Rogers
killed and wounded several of Roberts's Men, and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span> a great hole in
his Sloop, which his Carpenter with very great Difficulty (hundreds of
Bullets flying round him) stopt, and finding Capt. Rogers too strong
for him, tho' Graves did nothing, which if had, he must of necessity
been taken, he therefore run for it, as also did his Consort
Briganteen, which he never saw nor heard of since.</p>

<p>From Barbadoes Roberts went to an Island called Granada,<a name="FNanchor_12_839" id="FNanchor_12_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_839" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to the
Leeward of Barbadoes, where he carreen'd his Sloop, and from thence
this Spring with 45 Men he came to Newfoundland, into the Harbour of
Trepassi,<a name="FNanchor_13_840" id="FNanchor_13_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_840" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> towards the latter end of June last, with Drums beating,
Trumpets sounding, and other Instruments of Musick, English Colours
flying, their Pirate Flagg at the Topmast-Head, with Deaths Head and
Cutlash, and there being 22 sail in that Harbour, upon the sight of
the Pirate the Men all fled on Shore and left their Vessels, which
they possess'd themselves off, burnt, sunk and destroyed all of them,
excepting one Bristol Gally, which they designed to be their best
Pirate Ship, if a better did not present. After they did all the
mischief they could in that Harbour, they came on upon the Banks,
where they met nine or ten sail of Frenchmen, one of whom is the
Pirate Ship of 26 Guns abovesaid, taken from a French-man, unto whom
Roberts the Pirate gave the Bristol Gally, but sunk and destroyed all
the other French Vessels, taking first out what Guns were fit for his
own Ship, and all other valuable Goods.</p>

<p>Roberts the Pirate designed from Newfoundland to range thro' the
Western and Canary Islands, and so to the Southward, to the Island of
New Providence,<a name="FNanchor_14_841" id="FNanchor_14_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_841" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> possest by Negroe's, in South Latitude 17, which
they say is the place of the Pirates General Rendezvous, where they
have a For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>tification and a great Magazine of Powder, etc. where they
intend to spend their Money with the Portuguize Negro Women. Roberts
the Pirate says, that there is a French Pirate on the North Coast of
America, who gives no Quarter to any Nation, and if he met him, he
would give him none. The Pirates seems much enraged at Bristol Men,
for Capt. Rogers sake, whom they hate as they do the Spaniards.</p>

of the most famous pirates of his time, <i>i.e.</i>, of the years
1718-1724, the heyday of piracy in the eighteenth century. Capt.
Charles Johnson, in his account of that period, <i>A General History of
the Pyrates</i> (London, 1724), devotes nearly a third of his book (pp.
161-260 of the first edition) to Roberts, as "having made more Noise
in the World" than others, and declares (p. 3 of preface) that
"Roberts and his Crew, alone, took 400 Sail, before he was destroy'd".
Of his appearance we have this picture, from the same chronicler's
account of his last fight: a tall dark Welshman of near forty,
"Roberts himself made a gallant Figure, being dressed in a rich
crimson Damask Wastcoat, and Breeches, a red Feather in his Hat, and a
Gold Chain Ten Times round his Neck, a Sword in his Hand, and two pair
of Pistols hanging at the End of a Silk Sling, which was flung over
his Shoulders, according to the Fashion of the Pyrates" (p. 213). His
meteoric career of piracy lasted but four years.</p></div>

American Antiquarian Society's volume of royal proclamations relating
to America, <i>Transactions</i>, XII. 176-178.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_833" id="Footnote_6_833"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_833">[6]</a> When the survivors of Roberts's crew were tried at Cape
Corso Castle on the African coast in March and April, 1722, and
fifty-two of them executed, this man ("Harry Glasby") was acquitted,
for, though he had risen to be master of the principal pirate ship,
there was abundant evidence (Johnson, first ed., pp. 186, 235-238)
that he had always been unwilling to continue with the pirates, that
he had tried to escape, and that he had often shown himself humane.
Scott uses the name of Harry Glasby in <i>The Pirate</i>, vol. II., ch. 11,
borrowing it from Johnson.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_835" id="Footnote_8_835"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_835">[8]</a> Roberts's hostility toward Irishmen arose from the trick
played upon him by one of his lieutenants, an Irishman named Kennedy,
who on the coast of Surinam ran away with both his ship and a good
Portuguese prize. <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 166-169.</p></div>

A year later, on the West African coast, when they had captured in a
ship of the Royal African Company the chaplain of Cape Coast Castle,
and had asked him to join them, "alledging merrily, that their Ship
wanted a Chaplain", and he had declined, they gave him back all his
possessions, and "kept nothing which belonged to the Church, except
three Prayer-Books, and a Bottle-Screw, which, as I was inform'd by
one of the Pyrates himself, they said they had Occasion for, for their
own Use". <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 198.</p></div>

<p>This comes that the Lords Commissioners for Executing the Office of

within the jurisdiction of Admiralty contained in my Commission,<a name="FNanchor_4_845" id="FNanchor_4_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_845" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Namely, One Benja<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>min Norton of Rhode-Island, and One Joseph Whippole,
a Considerable Merchant of that Colony,<a name="FNanchor_5_846" id="FNanchor_5_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_846" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> did fit out a Brigantine,
and sent her under the Command of the said Norton to the West Indies
last Fall (a Vessel by Common Observation more fit for Pirates than
Trade for which they pretended to Employ her) who Fell in with the
Pirates at St. Lucia in January last, and was (as he saith) taken by
One Roberts a Pirate, though by the Sequel it appears, he is more to
be considered as one of their Assistants and Correspondents, for after
he had remained with them Six or Seven Weeks, They took a Ship Dutch
Built of 250 Tuns Burthen, or thereby, and having Loaded her with
Sugars, Cocoa, Negroes, etc. of very considerable Value, All this they
gave to him for his Brigantine though of much more Value than She, and
by the most Judicious in the Country, is supposed to have been
committed to him as one of their Trusties, to Vend the Cargo in that
Colony, a Practice not without precedent in that Colony these several
Years past, if my Information fail not;<a name="FNanchor_6_847" id="FNanchor_6_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_847" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> however, be that as it
will, he comes with this Ship and Cargo into Tarpaulin Cove,<a name="FNanchor_7_848" id="FNanchor_7_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_848" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a
Place lying between the Province of the Massachussets Bay and Rhode
Island, where (by the by) the Pirates used to come to infest Our
Coasts in April last: And did in a Clandestine Manner advise the said
Joseph Whipple of his arrival.</p>

<p>And having dropped Anchor there, he fired at, and brought too several
of Our Coasters, upon which a Rumour arose, that the Pirates were on
the Coast, whereby Our Coasters, except his Accomplices who understood
better, were deterred for some Days from Falling within his reach, And
in the interim, the aforesaid Whipple, with One Chris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>topher Almy, and
One Pease, also considerable Traders of New Port in Rhode Island, with
some others, did improve that Opportunity, and carried off and
conveyed about 30 of the Negroes, with considerable Quantities of the
Sugars, Cocoa, etc., partly in Sloops sent out by them for that
purpose, and partly in such others as they intrusted therewith, and a
great part of which was by the said Almy and Whipple directed to
Providence Plantacion and recommended to the Care and Conduct of One
Whipple,<a name="FNanchor_8_849" id="FNanchor_8_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_849" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Brother to the said Joseph, that Place being their
Ordinary Mart and Recepticles for such Cargoes. But so many
accessaries were concerned, and the Cargo so considerable, the Secret
was Discovered, and thereupon the Officers of his Majesty's Customs,
both in the Province of Massachussets Bay and Colony of Rhode Island,
did exert themselves, and the Collector at Boston did Seize upon the
Ship and remainder of the Cargo,<a name="FNanchor_9_850" id="FNanchor_9_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_850" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The said Benjamin Norton upon the
Discovery having relinquished the Ship and absconded. And the
<i>Surveyor and Searcher at Rhode Island did Seize upon and Secure the
Sloop</i> belonging to one Draper, employed by the said Joseph Whipple,
in which a considerable Quantities of the Sugars, etc., had been
carried off, And did insist against them, upon the breach of the Acts
of Trade, for <i>Neglect to make Entries as the Law directs</i>. Upon which
Informations I gave Decrees finding the same lawful Seizures, and
Ordered the Values thereof (after Sale should be made) to be Paid into
Court, in regard of the Circumstantial Case, and delivered up to the
Collector, etc., as Informers, upon their enacting and obliging
themselves in the Court of Admiralty to refund the Values in Case any
Owner should appear and make good their Title thereto within Twelve
Months. This is complyed with at Boston, but in the Colony of
Rhode-Island, though the Informations were Laid at the instance of the
Officers of the Customes, and that I had given Decrees Condemnator[y]
thereupon, and Or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>dered the Sales by Publick Vendue, Yet in regard I
had obliged them to Enact for Refunding, <i>The Collector</i>, in
conjunccion with the Governor at Rhode Island,<a name="FNanchor_10_851" id="FNanchor_10_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_851" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and some others of
his Assistants who were concerned in these, who had a part of the
Goods trusted in their Hands, till the same should be Sold by Warrant
of the Court of Admiralty, Did put a Stop to the Sale appointed by me;
And by an Act of the Governor and his Assistants have taken on them to
sell and Dispose thereof, and to lodge the Price in other hands than
by Decrees of Court was appointed, <i>albeit by their Charter</i> they have
no right so to do.</p>

<p>I being apprized of this their Proceeding that since the Cargo was
Condemned, and the Sale thereof appointed by the Court of Admiralty
which issued upon Informacions laid by the Collector and Surveyor of
his Majesty's Plantation Duties, who had the Sugars and Cocoa in their
Custody, and produced the Negroes before me in Court, There was an
Order past by the Governor and Council or Assistants at Rhode Island
directed to the Sheriffe, who of before had been one of these who put
an Estimate upon the Negroes by appointment of the Judge of Admiralty,
and to whom the Judge had Committed the Custody of the Negroes in
Court, Discharging him to deliver them up to the Judges Orders. I went
to Rhode Island, (though I had a Deputy there) and waited on the
Governor, and shewed to him my <i>Commission under the Great Seal of
Admiralty</i>, which also was Recorded in their Books, and insisted with
him on this, That I am uncontrovertedly by my Commission the Competent
Judge in these Parts upon the Contravention of the Acts of Trade, And
moreover, That by my Commission I am obliged to enquire after and
secure the Goods of all Pirates, etc., The words of my Commission
being <i>ad inquirendum et investigandum de omnibus et singulis bonis
Piratarum</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_11_852" id="FNanchor_11_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_852" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And as I was authorize[d] for that Effect, so I
conceived that the Governor and his Assistants, their business was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
only to be aiding and assisting to me in the Execution which I
expected. And therefore Demanded of him, That according to my Order in
Court, the Negroes might be produced as formerly by the Sheriffe in
Court in Order to Sale. And that the Publick Court House, and House
where Vendues are usually made, may be made Patent to me as
heretofore, And that the Governor's Order for Shutting up thereof and
denying Access to me may be recalled. At the same time I also informed
him that I was accountable to the Lords of Admiralty or Vice Admiralty
for the Values and Produce of the Sales made by my Decrees. During
this Conference a Quorum of his Assistants in Council came in, before
whom I again resumed my desire, To which I received this Answer, That
the Governor <i>considers himself as Vice Admiral</i> and that as such he
hath right <i>to intromett</i> with All Goods belonging to Pirates, and
that <i>by the Charter all such is given to them</i>, and that he would not
allow me the Priviledge of the Court House, unless I would comply with
and acquiesse in their Acts of Council. To which I replyed, <i>Their
Charter contains no such Grant of Admiralty jurisdiction nor right to
any Piratical</i> Goods (as will be evident on perusal thereof), Yea <i>in
the Year 1703/4 the Queen Discharged them from exercising any part of
Admiralty jurisdiction, which was complyed with ever since and the
Court constitute by the Kings Commission</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_853" id="FNanchor_12_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_853" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> And as to submitting to
their Acts of Council when derogatory to His Majestys Interest and the
Authority of his Court of Admiralty (which I conceive their Act of
which I complain is) was what I could not comply with, without
rendering my self unworthy of the Trust committed to me and betraying
thereof. Notwithstanding of all which they persisted in their
Resolution, and not only Debarred me from the Use of the Court House
but also to deliver up the Negroes, etc., to be sold, as I had
ordered, and afterward sold them amongst themselves at an undervalue:
By which their Contempt of his Majesty's Authority and Court of
Admiralty is obvious, Yea, their <i>incroaching upon and usurping of the
Admiralty Jurisdiction contrary to Queen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span> Ann's express Order</i>
abovementioned is Palpable, And their refusing to give that aid and
assistance which the Judge did justly require of them in the terms of
his Commission appear to be highly punishable, if not a just ground
for forfeiture of their Charter, more especially being conjoyned with
this of a great many of that Colony, their keeping a continued
Correspondence with the Pirates, which renders the fair Traders very
uneasy, and insecure. All which I humbly submit to their Lordships
Consideration, and pray for redress, suitable encouragement, and
support to him, who is</p>

1, 1724, "After Lecture I heard the good News of Andrew Harradine and
others rising up and subjugating Phillips the Pirat". <i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</i>, XLVII. 335, where extracts telling the story are
transcribed from the <i>Boston News-Letter</i> of Apr. 16, May 7, and May
21. Cheesman threw John Nutt, the master of the pirate ship,
overboard; "Harradine struck down [John] Phillips the Captain with an
Adds, and another man struck Burrell the Boatswain with a Broad Ax;
and the rest fell upon James [or Joseph] Sparks the Gunner, and having
in a few Minutes dispatched the said Four Officers, the rest of the
Pirates immediately surrendered themselves Prisoners". The result of
the trials here recorded was that William White and John Rose Archer
the quartermaster were condemned to die, William Phillips (not the
pirate captain), and William Taylor were reprieved and later pardoned,
the others were acquitted. <i>Acts and Resolves of Mass. Bay</i>, X. 627,

<p>Then the Kings Evidences were called and sworn. John Masters, late

a Pyrate sloop Commanded by John Phillips, Captain, that they took

Phillips was about to dismiss this Depont. with his vessel he askt
this Depont. whether he would carry home with him one Willm. Phillips,
who was then on board the Pyrate Sloop, having one of his leggs Cut
off,<a name="FNanchor_6_880" id="FNanchor_6_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_880" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and whom the Depont. saith is one of the Prisoners now at the
Bar; and the Depont. answered, Provided the Captain and the Men were
willing he would Carry him with him, but the sd. William Phillips
refused to go with the Depont. saying if he should they would hang

<p>John Filmore Deposed. Saith That he knows William Phillips. he was
taken out of a Sloop sometime in October last. the first vessel that
was taken after Phillips's being taken was a Brigantine. Cannot say
that Phillips went on board the Brigantine. he never saw him Armed
with other arms than a Cutlass. That in February they took a snow
bound from New York to Barbados, one Laws Master.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span> Samuel Ferne, James
Wood, William Taylor and Wm. Phillips, one of Prisoners at the Bar,
went on board the snow armed with Cutlasses, who kept on board and
Navigated sd snow, as far to the southward as the Lattitude of 21,
where Ferne and Wood, attempting to run away with the scooner, in
order thereto Confined Taylor and Phillips: But Capt. Phillips the
Pyrate firing upon the snow, she brought too, and the sd Ferne was
Commanded on board, but he refused and fired upon Capt. Phillips and
Compelled the Prisoner at the Bar, William Phillips, to come and abide
upon Deck, where he had his left leg shot by Nutt, which was
afterwards Cut off. That Isaac Lassen was taken at Newfoundland in
Septr last. That he was generally set at the helm to steer the vessel.
he was once set on board the snow armed, when Fern, Wood, etc., were
running away with her. he never was forward nor did he ever see him
Guilty of any Act of Pyracy when vessels were taken, nor Share any
plunder, Except that they now and then obliged him to take a Shirt or
a pair of stockings when almost naked. That he was knowing of the
rising to subdue the Pyrates, and took hold of the Captains Arm, when
Harradine struck him in the head with the Ads. That Henry Gyles was
taken in February and forced to go with the Pyrates; Nutt obliged him
to keep a Journal being an Artist.<a name="FNanchor_7_881" id="FNanchor_7_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_881" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> he never saw him armed on board,
that he was always Contriving to get away, and has often told this
Depont. that he would Escape if possible. that he was knowing of the
rising against the pyrates and forward and Active in it. That Charles
Ivemay was taken and forced out of the same ship that Cheesman the
Carpenter was. that he always behaved himself Civilly. he never saw
him Armed. That he was knowing of and brisk and Active in the rising
against the Pyrates. That there was no vessel taken after John
Bootman, John Coombes and Henry Payne were taken.</p>

<p>Edward Cheesman Deposeth That William Phillips leg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span> was Cut off before
he<a name="FNanchor_8_882" id="FNanchor_8_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_882" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was taken by the Pyrates, That Henry Gyles was Guilty of no Act
of Pyracy that he ever saw or heard of, that he behaved himself
Civilly, kept a Journal being an Artist, That he has often told this
Depont. he would contrive some way or other to make his Escape, that
he was knowing of the Rising and forward and Active in it. That Isaac
Lassen behaved himself Civilly and always seemed to him to be a forced
man, That he never saw him in Arms; was the Man that took hold of Capt
Phillips's Arm when Harradine struck him. That Charles Ivemay was
Obliged and forced out of the same ship; he never was armed or forward
when vessels were taken, That he was Privy to the Design of subduing
the Pyrates and active in Executing it. That Bootman, Combes and Payne
seemed to be forced and there was no vessel taken after they Came on
board.</p>

<p>Andrew Harradine Deposeth That Phillips's leg was Cut off before
his<a name="FNanchor_9_883" id="FNanchor_9_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_883" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> being taken, knows nothing of him, That Lassen always behaved
himself well, he never saw him armed, that he has several times told
this Depont. that the Pyrates should never Carry him off the Coast to
suffer by them as he had done already, that he was the first that took
hold of the Captain, when this Depont. struck him and killed him. That
he never saw any thing by Gyles and Ivemay but what was Civil, no ways
Active as Pyrates, that they were both acquainted with the design of
subduing the Pyrates, and stirring and brisk in the Execution thereof.
That Bootman, Combes and Payne came on board after he was taken, there
was no Vessel taken after their being on board. That Bootman was Privy
to and Active in the subduing the Pyrates, and Combes and Payne seemed
to him to be forced men.</p>

<p>The Witnesses having been Severally Examined and Deposed as aforesd.,
the Prisoners were asked whether they had any thing to say on their
own Defence. William Phillips said he was forced by the Pyrates out of
the Sloop <i>Glasgow</i>, William Warden Master, that sometime after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span> he
was on board, he understood there were articles drawn up,<a name="FNanchor_10_884" id="FNanchor_10_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_884" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> for the
Captain Called him auft, and with his pistol Cocked demanded him to
sign the sd. Articles or Else he would blow his Brains out, which he
refused to do, Reminding the Captain of his promise that he should be
cleared; but the Captn. Declaring that it should not hurt him, and
Insisting on it as aforesd., he was Obliged to sign the sd. Articles.
Then when Ferne and Wood were running away with the snow, they never
told him what design they were upon but told him they were going to
Holmes's hole,<a name="FNanchor_11_885" id="FNanchor_11_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_885" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and there every one to shift for himself, and the
rest alledging they were forced men and some of them that they were in
the secret of subduing the Pyrates and active in it, and others that
there was no vessels taking whilst they were on board.</p>

<p>Then the Prisoners being taken away and all withdrawn but the
Register, The Court maturely Weighed and Considered the Evidences and
Cases of the Prisoners and by a Plurality of Voices found the sd
William Phillips Guilty of the Pyracies, Robberies and Felonys
Exhibited against him, and by an unanimous voice found the sd. Isaac
Lassen, Henry Gyles, Charles Ivemay, John Bootman, John Coombes and
Henry Payne not Guilty.</p>

<p>Then the Prisoners were brought to the Bar and the President
acquainted William Phillips That the Court had found him Guilty of the
Pyracies, Robberies and Felonies Exhibited against him, and asked him
if he had any thing to say why sentence of Death should not pass upon
him for his Offences.</p>

<p>And he offering nothing Material the President Pronounced sentence of
Death against him in the following words&mdash;</p>

<p>"You, William Phillips, are to go from hence to the place from whence
you Come and from thence to the place of Execution, and there you are
to be hanged by the neck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span> until you are dead, and God of His Infinite
Mercy save your Soul."</p>

<p>And the President Pronounced the said Isaac Lassen, Henry Gyles,
Charles Ivemay, John Bootman, John Coombs and Henry Payne not Guilty.</p>

<p>Then the Court adjourned till to morrow morning Eight of the Clock.</p>

or Cutlass; That Archer told him that he was one of Teaches<a name="FNanchor_2_887" id="FNanchor_2_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_887" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> men and
went into South Carolina upon the Act of Grace. That White told this
Depont. he was sorry he came out upon the Accot. and if he Could he
would get away before they went off the Coast. That he heard William
Taylor say they were Carrying him to Virginia to be sold<a name="FNanchor_3_888" id="FNanchor_3_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_888" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and they
met with these honest Men, meaning the Pyrates, and he listed himself
to go with them.</p>

<p>After the Kings Evidences had been severally Examined the Prisoners at
the Bar were asked what they had to say in their own Defence. William
White says he is sorry he should Commit such a sin, that he was in
Drink when he went away with Phillips, Nutt, etc., in Mr Minotts
scooner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span> John Archer and Willm Taylor say they were forced Men, and
Archer, being asked how he Came to be Quarter Master, Answered that
the Company thought him the fittest Man for a Quarter master and so
Chose him.</p>

<p>Then the Kings Advocate General summed up the nature of the Evidence
against the Prisoners, and the Prisoners were taken from the Bar, and
the Court cleared and in private.</p>

<p>Then the Court Maturely weighed and Considered the Evidences and the
Prisoners Cases, and Unanimously found William White, John Rose
Archer, and William Taylor Guilty of Pyracy, robbery and Felony
according to the Articles Exhibited against them. Then the Prisoners
were brought to the Bar and the President acquainted them that the
Court by a Unanimous Voice had found them Guilty. Then the Court
Adjourned to three a Clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The Court met and Opened according to Adjournm't by Proclamation and
Ordered John Baptis and Peter Taffery, two French Men, to be brought
[to] the Bar, and they were brought to the Bar accordingly and ordered
to attend to the articles read agt. them for Pyracy, Robbery and
Felony.</p>

<p>And the Register read the articles, which were the four last articles
of those Exhibited against William Phillips, Isaac Lassen, etc., to
which articles the sd John Baptis and Peter Taffery severally pleaded
not Guilty. Then the Kings Evidences being sworn, Called and
Interrogated, Deposed as follows.</p>

<p>William Lancy Deposed That whilst he was on board the Pyrat, up[on]
their Coming up with a Cape Anne vessel, Phillips the Captain [of] the
Pyrat ordered John Baptis to fetch up a Musquet, which he did, and
when the Captain was going to take the Musquet [to] fire, Baptis
twicht it out of his hands and fired it him[self], That Baptist was
one that went on board a sloop, one [Beel] Master, Armed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>David Jaw, belonging to the Scooner [whereof] Will'm Lancy was
Skipper, Deposed That John Baptis Came [on] board their Vessel with
several others armed. That Baptis Came [up] to this Depont. and Damnd
him and kicked him in his legs and [pointed] to his Boots,<a name="FNanchor_1_889" id="FNanchor_1_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_889" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which
was a sign as this Depont understood it that he wanted his Boots, and
he accordingly pull'd them off and Baptist took them.</p>

<p>John Filmore Deposed That John Baptis and Peter Taffery, upon the
rising against the Pyrates, with others fell upon James Sparkes, the
Gunner of the Pyrate, and killed him and threw [him] Overboard.</p>

<p>Edward Cheesman Deposed That John Baptis always carried himself
Civilly on board and was always for[ward] to rise upon the Pyrates.
That Peter Taffery was [more active] than Baptis, that he saw him fire
at vessels [two or three] times.</p>

<p>Henry Giles Deposed That William<a name="FNanchor_2_890" id="FNanchor_2_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_890" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Phillips, the Capt[tain] of the
Pyrate, was always afraid of John Baptis that he would do him some
damage, That Baptis was always ready and forward to rise upon the
Pyrates, when they talkt of rising, That he has seen them go Armed on
board Vessels, but cant say he had any share of the plunder, That
Taffery was more active than Baptis.</p>

<p>Andrew Harradine Deposed he never saw any thing but what was Civil in
Baptis and Taffery, That they were very forward upon the rising, as
soon as they perceived what they were about, and were very much
rejoiced when it was done and they had got their Liberty.</p>

<p>Then the Court ordered That all Persons should depart but the Judges
and Register; and having Maturely weighed the Evidences unanimously
found John Baptist and Peter Taffry not Guilty. Then the Prisoners
were brought to the Bar and the President declared That the Court had
found them not Guilty.</p>

<p>Then the Court Adjourned till the Morrow Morning.</p>

<p>And the Court being met according to Adjournment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span> Francisco, Pedro,
and Pierro, three negros, were brought to the Bar and Arraigned, but
no Evidences appearing to alledge any Acts of Pyracy against them, but
all [alledging] that they were Imployed in Cooking the Kettle, The
Court [unanimously] found them not [Guilty].<a name="FNanchor_3_891" id="FNanchor_3_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_891" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_892" id="Footnote_4_892"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_892">[4]</a> Archer and White were executed on June 2, 1724. Cotton
Mather ministered to them in their last days, adding, one would think,
a new horror to death. The sermon he preached at them was forthwith
printed by him, <i>The Converted Sinner ... A Sermon Preached in Boston,
May 31, 1724, In the Hearing and at the Desire of certain Pirates</i>
[Archer and White], <i>a little before their Execution, To which there
is added, A more private Conference of a Minister with them</i> (Boston,
1724). With his usual insufferable vanity, he indicates that the
capture of the pirates was widely attributed to his public prayer
against pirates on Sunday, Apr. 26: "Behold, before the week was out,
there comes in a Vessel wherein" were the captive pirates. But the
victorious mutiny against the pirates occurred on Apr. 18, and without
disparaging Dr. Mather's influence in the councils of Heaven, it seems
doubtful if the rising could have been caused by prayers publicly
offered by him on the 26th. After the trial he adds: "One of the first
Things which the Pyrates, who are now so much the Terror of them that
haunt the Sea, impose on their poor Captives, is, to curse Dr. M&mdash;&mdash;r.
The Pyrates now strangely fallen into the Hands of Justice here, make
me the first Man, whose Visits and Counsils and Prayers they beg for.
Some of them under Sentence of Death, chuse to hear from me the Last
Sermon they hear in the world. The Sermon is desired for Publication".

Interro. mention'd, standing in for Santa Crux in Teneriffe, and came
last from Corke, and as the Master thereof said to this Depon't was

therefore can't say of his own knowledge that these are the Papers
taken on board, but verily believes they are, for these Papers were
sent to this Depon't by his Lieuten't from said Vessell some short
Time after she was taken, and two of the Papers, namely, an English
Mediterranean Pass<a name="FNanchor_12_925" id="FNanchor_12_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_925" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and a Paper in Spanish Importing a Clearance,

the Papers were Concealed.</p>

<p><i>Interro. 4.</i> Did you hear the sd Master of the Sloop aforesd Declare

Kingdom of Ireland, and also that he went from Teneriffe to Corke,
where he purchased sd Loading, and was to return with the same
immediately to Teneriffe, where two of his owners were Inhabitants and
one other owner an Inhabitant of Holland.</p>

<p><i>Interro. 5.</i> What was done with the Cargo after the Vessell and Cargo
was thus taken?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> All the Cargo with the Vessell was Carried into Madera and all or
the greatest part of sd Cargo was Landed there.</p>

<p><i>Interro. 6.</i> Is the Sloop now under Seizure the same Sloop that was
thus taken?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Two of them went on board the Man of War there, and two others
went on board this sd Privateer, and the Mate was carried to
Gibraltar, where he heard he ran away.</p>

<p><i>Interro. 8.</i> Do you know or have you heard what Nation those hands
were of?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The Master, Mate and one hand more he understood to be Scotch,
two hands more to be Irish, one Boy belonging to London and a
Portugueze or Spanish negro man.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, Do you know anything further relating to sd Vessell and
Cargo or any other former Voyages the said Vessell had made and where
to?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p>1740, August 12th. John Rous, the Subscriber to the aforegoing, made
oath to the Truth thereof Before Me.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Rob't Auchmuty</span>, Judge Ad'y.</p>

<p>Captain Rous being Sworn in Court acknowledged his Examination already
taken was the Truth. He also Declared there was Water enough on board
the Sloop <i>Amsterdam Post</i> to carry her into Madera, and actually
served them for that purpose, viz. three of said Sloop's Crew and five
belonging to the Privateer, which was one more than was on board at
the time of the Capture; That Capt. Mackay was summoned by a
Portugueze officer from the Consul<a name="FNanchor_13_926" id="FNanchor_13_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_926" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> at Captn. Dumaresqs request, as
Capt. Mackay told him, to go in the Privateer Sloop to Gibraltar in
order for a Tryal; that Capt. Mackay told him he sailed from Holland
to the Canaries two years as an English Man, and that he never sailed
under Dutch Colours till the War with Spain; That Capt. Mackay told
him that the Sloop at the time of the Capture belong'd to Mr. Devernet
of Amsterdam and his two sons who lived at Teneriffe, who were all
Frenchmen. That to his knowledge he never saw any of the Cargo Landed
at Madera; that his Lieu't Immediately upon the Capture brought the
Papers of the said Vessell to him, who having first perused them
Sealed them up; that some short time after the said Mackay exprest to
him his Desire, in case a certain Paper was found on board, that it
would be useless to this Depon't, and that he would have it Concealed,
whereupon this Depon't asked him what the Paper was and where in the
Vessell it could be found, but the said Mackay would not inform him,
and this desire of the said Mackays he repeated several times, and in
about two Days after there was brought to this Depon't by John Teit,
who acted as Mate on board the said Prize, two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span> Papers from on Board,
viz. an English Mediterranean Pass wherein the said Master and Sloop
was named, and a Spanish Clearance as of an English Vessell, which was
found as he said as mentioned by this Depon't in his former
Examinat'n, and afterwards the said Mackay repeated his Desire in case
a certain Paper, not naming it, should be found not to show it to
any&mdash;Whereupon this Depon't Informed him that he had got what he meant
and shew'd him the said Pass and Clearance, and then the said Master
again pressed him not to shew the same to the Consul. That upon his
arrival at Madera he Delivered the Papers so found and Seal'd up,
together with the said Pass and Spanish Clearance, to Capt. Dumaresq
in the Consul's House, that Capt. Dumaresq then delivered them to the
Consul, who broke open the Seal and perused the Papers together with
Capt. Dumaresq; and that he verily believes the Papers now in Court
are all the Papers he so delivered up, excepting the said Pass.</p>

<p>The Court was then adjourn'd to the 21st of Aug't Curr't at 7 a Clock
a.m., at which time it was opened, when Michael Dumaresq being first
Sworn Declar'd that his Examination already taken was the Truth. He
further Declared that when Capt. Dumaresq arrived at Gibraltar he
heard him say he wou'd go to the Govern'r,<a name="FNanchor_14_927" id="FNanchor_14_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_927" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> to the Admiral,<a name="FNanchor_15_928" id="FNanchor_15_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_928" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and
to the Judge of the Admiralty, that accordingly he saw the Captain go
to Sir Chaloner Ogle, who was the Admiral, and to the Governour; that
he heard Capt. Dumaresq Say the Admiral told him he believ'd the
Vessell would be condemn'd; and that the Person called the Judge of
Admiralty at Gibraltar, upon Capt. Dumaresq application to him for a
Tryal, told him he had no Commission or Instructions to Try any
Capture but expected the same from England every Day; That upon the
arrival of the Sloop <i>Amsterdam Post</i> at Madera there was an officer
put on board her from the Provedore<a name="FNanchor_16_929" id="FNanchor_16_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_929" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and Judge of the Poor, that he
remain'd on Board till other officers came on Board<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span> and unladed the
Vessell and that Capt. Dumaresq paid the officer two Bitts<a name="FNanchor_17_930" id="FNanchor_17_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_930" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a Day
and his Victuals during his Stay on Board.</p>

<p>Abraham Martin, being Sworn in Court, Declared that his Examination
already taken was true. The Court was then adjourn'd to Saterday the
23d Curr't at half an hour past 2 a Clock p.m., at which time it was
open'd and several Papers were produc'd and Read in Court, which are
as follows, viz.</p>

War existed between Great Britain and Spain; the Dutch were neutrals.
Briefly, the <i>Amsterdam Post</i> was provided with two sets of papers,
one Spanish, to be used in case she were overhauled by a Spanish
war-vessel or privateer, one Dutch, to be used in case she fell into
British hands. Robert Auchmuty was judge of the admiralty court in

to the Terrours of Death, But the Mercifull God opened a Door of
Safety for us when We were in the utmost Distress, for as We were

<p>Capt. Dixon, who Translated the Several Spanish Papers aforewritten,
made Oath in Court that he had Translated them according to the best
of his Skill and Judgment.</p>

<p>The Court was then Adjourn'd to the 25th Curr't at 8 a Clock A.M., at
which Time it was Opened and both Parties fully heard by their
advocates, after which the Court was Adjourn'd to the Thirtieth Curr't
at 10 a Clock a.m., at which Time the Judge Decreed the Vessell and
Cargo a Lawfull Prize, and on the first of September following
delivered his Reasons for Adjudication in Open Court, which is as
follows, viz.</p>

<p>I have duly Considered the Preparatory Examinations and all the Papers
and Writings which were Sworn to be found and taken in and with the
Capture (a Mediterranean Pass excepted) and also the Depositions given
in Open Court, and likewise with great Deliberation weighed the
Arguments of the Advocates, as well on the part of the Captor as on
the part of the Claimant, and it appears to Me that the Sloop Libelled
against was a British Bottom, Navi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>gated by British Subjects, and that
the Master thereof, &AElig;neas Mackay, on the 11th of July, 1738, had
Granted to him for said Sloop by the Right Hono'ble the Lords
Commissioners for Executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of Great
Britain a Mediterranean Pass No. 2533, which was found on board the
said Sloop at the Time of the Capture. It also appears to Me that the
said Master, on the 16th Septr., 1739, by the Name of &AElig;neas Mackay of
London, Captain, took the usual Oath of a Porter of the City of
Amsterdam; that on the 22d of said Month the said Master before the
Magistrates and Rulers of that City made oath that the Vessell
aforesd., of which he was then Master, belonged to a House in that
Province and afterwards the said Vessell in Holland as to her
Clearing, Passport, Visiting, Taxing, etc., was Treated as a Dutch
Bottom; that on the 2d of Octobr. following the said Master hired a
Chamber in Amsterdam <i>for one year</i>, But in case no one appeared in
October following then it should be in the power of the Lessor to Lett
the same to another, and he Enter'd the Day following, and shortly
after sailed in said Vessell to Teneriffe, from whence in a few Days
he and his hands, British Subjects, and after the Proclamation of War,
with Two Passes, viz. the said Mediterranean Pass and a Dutch Pass,
sailed to Cork in the Kingdom of Ireland, having a Great quantity of
Money, as appears by his Journal; there he purchases a Loading,
Chiefly Provisions, Clears out for the Maderas, and accordingly had
one Sett of Bills of Lading for that Port, to be delivered to William
Callanach or to his assigns, who to Me appears to be a fictitious
Person, and one other Sett of Bills of Lading for said Cargo to be
Deliverd at the Port of C&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_2_965" id="FNanchor_2_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_965" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> unto Divernett Freres, who plainly
appeard to me then to be two Merch'ts Settled Inhabit'ts at Teneriffe,
one of them since dead, the other there still Inhabiting; that on the
15th of January, 1739, the said Vessell was taken, as set forth in the
Libel, with the said Papers and the Books of Acco'ts of the said
Master, and by which acco'ts it turns out to my Satisfaction if those
two Brothers the Devernets were not solely Owners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span> they were
Principally so. It further appears that the reason assigned by the
Master, when taken, of being so near Teneriffe and setting in for that
Port was for Water, when in Truth it's in Proof they were Letting out
their Water Secretly, and after Stopt by the Captors there was Water
for one hand more than the Crew belonging to the Sloop for three
Weeks, which carried them into Madera, and if the Say of some of the
Sailors is to be Credited they were Shipped at Corke for Teneriffe;
and all this to Demonstration Shews which of those two Setts of Bills
of Lading must be understood to be Real. It also appears in Proof,
certifyed under the hand of the British Consul at Madera (whose name
thereto subscrib'd is owned by the Claimant to be of his proper
handwriting), that the said Cargo was there by force Unloaded, by
Means Whereof not brought with the Vessell to this Port, So that in
fine here is a British Master endeavouring to Commence Dutchman, a
British Vessell with two Passes, British and Dutch, and to be
occasionally<a name="FNanchor_3_966" id="FNanchor_3_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_966" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> either a British or Dutch Bottom Navigated by British
Subjects in time of War with Spain, Sails from Teneriffe with Money to
Cork in Ireland, there purchases a Cargo of Provisions bound directly
back to our Enemies, makes a false Clearance as if bound to Madera,
has two Setts of Bill of Lading, the One which is Real to Deliver the
Cargo at a Port part of the Dominions of a Prince in Enmity with us,
and to Persons there Inhabiting who appear to be altogether or
Principally owners, Carrying the King's Subjects to Enemies, whereby
they by Menaces or Corruption or both may be drawn from their
Allegiance, and happily is thus taken, and to have it a Question
whether it's a Lawfull Capture or not is somewhat Extraordinary, for
my part till I am better Informed from Home I shall never Ballance in
Cases so Wickedly Contrived and contrary to the Conduct of plain
Trading and Simple Honesty, But in Justice to my King and Country
always Condemn, and if this Mackay was in Court, notwithstanding all
his Subtlety and Double Dealing and his pretended Naturalization
Certifyed from Teneriffe, as in the Case, I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span> order him in
Custody till delivered up to the Government. Therefore on the whole I
Adjudge and Condemn the Vessell and Cargo Libelled against as a
Lawfull Prize, Entirely to belong to and be Divided between and among
the Owners of the Sloop that Seized and Took her as aforesaid, and the
several Persons which were on Board the same, in such Shares and
Proportions as were agreed on with the Owners aforesd. and the persons
thus entituled thereto by virtue of such agreement among themselves.
And as to the Objection that the Cargo is not brought in the Vessell,
the Manner of it's being forced from the Captor is Certified, and that
this Court may notwithstanding proceed to Condemnation is not only the
practice of the Court, but so known in the Kings Court, as in the
Cases the King v. Broom, Brown and Burton v. Francklyn.<a name="FNanchor_4_967" id="FNanchor_4_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_967" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

135. Broom, master of a ship of the Royal African Company, captured a
French ship off the Guinea coast, sold ship and goods at Barbados, and
kept the proceeds. Franklyn, the king's proctor, exhibited a libel
against him in the High Court of Admiralty, for embezzlement of the
admiralty perquisites belonging to the king. After sentence, Broom
moved the King's Bench for a prohibition, to transfer the case to that
court, but the prohibition was refused. The case of Brown and Burton
<i>vs.</i> Franklyn (Hilary term, 10 Will. III.) was similar. Brown and
Burton were masters of two ships of the East India Company, who had
taken a rich French prize at the island of Johanna (see <a href="#DOC_58">doc. no. 58</a>,
<a href="#Footnote_3_404">note 3</a>) and taken the goods for themselves and left the ship there,
without going to the trouble of having it properly condemned as prize.
The case is reported in Carthew, p. 474.</p></div>

and that he wou'd not Give him leave to beat up for Voluntiers. the
Chief Reason he Gave was that the City was thined of hands by the 2
Country Sloops that were fitted out by the Council to Crueze after the
Spanish privateers on the Coast and that his Grace the Duke of
Newcastle had wrote him word<a name="FNanchor_12_983" id="FNanchor_12_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_983" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that if Admiral Vernon or Genl.
Wentworth shoud writte for more Recruits to Use his Endeavours to Gett
them, so that he could not Give Encouragem't to any privateers to take
their men away. Three of the hands that went up to York left us, Viz.
George Densey, John Holmes and William Webster. Att 4 PM. Edward
Sampford our Pilott went a shoar in a Conoe with four more hands
without Leave from the Capt. when he Came on Board again the Capt.
talkt to him and found that he was a Mutineous Quarelsome fellow so
Ordered him to bundle up his Clothes and Go a shoare for Good. he
Carryed with him 5 more hands, Viz. Duncan McKenley, Foelix Burn, John
Smith, Humphry Walters and John Taylor (poor Encouragement to Gett
hands when they leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span> Us so fast). After they were Gone I read the
Articles to those on Board who Readily Signed So hope we shall Lead a
peaceable Life. Remains out of the 41 hands that Came with Us from
Rhode Island, 29 hands.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 29th.</i> About 4 PM. Saw a Sloop. Gave Chase but the Weather
being Calm was forced to Gett out Our Oars. fired our Bow Chase to
bring her too, but we tacking about and the people in Confusion, Night
Coming on, it being very Foggy, Coud not Speak to her. by her Course
she was bound to the Northw'd. Lost Sight of Our prize. The two
Englishman that were taken prisoners By the Spanish privateer Signed
Our Articles, their Names John Evergin and Sam'l Elderidge.</p>

<p><i>Thursday 30th.</i> Nothing Remarkable these 24 hours. Att 5 AM. Saw a
Sloop standing to the Northward and another a Stern of Us. bore down
to the Latter and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span> Our Signal agreed on. found her to be Our
prize. Opened a bb. of beef and 1 tierce of bread. the two Men that
had signed the day before had Arms Given them.</p>

<p><i>Friday 31t.</i> Calm weather these 24 hours. Our prize Sent his boat on
board of Us for bread and Water. Killed the other 2 hogs we had taken
on board. drew 2 Copys of the Capt's. Commission.</p>

<p><i>Saturday Aug'st 1st.</i> The prize still alongside of Us. Ordered the
Master to Send Us 2 hogs for the Sloops Use, Also the Negro prisoner,
having been Informed that he was Capt. of a Comp'y of Indians,
Mollattos and Negroes that was att the Retaking of the Fort att St.
Augus'ne formerly taken Under the Command of that worthlest
G&mdash;&mdash;O&mdash;&mdash;pe who by his treachory Suffered so many brave fellows to be
mangled by those barbarians.<a name="FNanchor_46_1018" id="FNanchor_46_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_1018" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> the Negro went Under the Name of
Signior Capitano Francisco. Sent one of the Mollatto's in his Room on
board the prize. Gave the people a pale of punch.</p>

<p><i>Sunday 2d.</i> Att 1 PM. We Examined the Negro who franckly owned that
he was Capt. of a Comp'y as aforesaid and that his Commission was on
board the privateer, that he went privatter'g in hopes of Getting to
the Avanah<a name="FNanchor_47_1019" id="FNanchor_47_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_1019" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and that there he might Gett a passage for to Go to old
Spain to Gett the Reward of his brave Actions. We then askt him if it
was his Comp'y that had used the English so barbarously when taken att
the Fort. he denyed that it was his Comp'y but laid that Cruel Action
to the Florida Indians and nothing more Coud we Gett out of him. We
then tyed him to a Gun and made the Doctor Come with Instruments
Seemingly to Castrate him as they had Served the English, thinking by
that means to Gett some Confession out of him, but he still denyed it.
we then tyed a Molatto one that was taken with him to know if he knew
anything about the Matter. We Gave him a dozen of Stripes and he
declared that he knew nothing more than his being Capt. of a Comp'y
att that time but that the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span> fellow on board the Sloop knew all
about it. We Sent to him and he declared the wholle truth that it was
the Florida Indians that had Committed the fact Under his Comand, but
knew not if he was Consenting to it. However to make Sure and to make
him Remember that he bore such a Commission we Gave him 200 Lashes and
then pickled him and left him to the Doctor to take Care of his Sore
A-se. Opened a tierce of bread, and killed the 2 hogs.</p>

<p><i>Munday 3d.</i> Small breeze of Wind. About 10 Saw a Schooner Standing to
No'ward. Gave her Chase.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday 4th.</i> A Fine breeze of Wind. Still in Chase of the Schooner.
Att 5 PM. Gave her a Gun in hopes to bring her too, to know who she
was, but she did not mind it neither hoisted any Colours. she bore
down upon Us, then takt and bore away. We fired 10 Shott but all did
not Signify for she hug'd her Wind<a name="FNanchor_48_1020" id="FNanchor_48_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_1020" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and it Growing dark and having
a Good pair of heels we lost Sight of her. We imagined it was a
No'ward Schooner both by her built and Course, But lett her be what
she will she had a brave fellow for a Com'r. Opened a bb. of pork. In
chaseing Lost Sight of Our prize.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 5th.</i> Fine Breeze of Wind. The Man att Mast head about 2
PM. Spyed 5 Sail of Vessells Steering to the Westward. Gave them Chase
till 1 AM. and overtook them about 2. we coud observe them att a Great
distance to Load<a name="FNanchor_49_1021" id="FNanchor_49_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_1021" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of us. Lay too till 4, then begun the Chase

which we had out of the prize. Opened a tierce of bread. Provisions
Expended from June the 5 till July the 5, being one month, 6 bbs. of
beef, 2 bbs. of pork, 1 bb. of bread and 6 tierces of bread.</p>

<p><i>Thursday 6th.</i> Still in Chase of the 5 Vessells. Sett our Spritsail,
Topsail and Square Sail with a fine Breeze of Wind. About 11 AM. One
of Ships brought too and fired a Gun to wait for a Sloop that was in
Comp'y with her, and to wait for Us. We took in all Our Small Sails
and bore down to her and hoisted Our penant. When along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>side of her
she fired 6 Shot att Us but did Us no damage, We still Hedging upon
her and Gave her Our broadside and then stood off. The Sloop tackt
imediatly and bore down upon Us in hopes to Gett Us between the Ships,
As We Suppose to peper Us, Att the Sight of Which We Gave them three
Chears. Our people all Agreed in General to fight them and told the
Capt. if heed venture his Sloop they'd Venture their Lives, but the
Capt. Seemed Unwilling and Gave for Reason that the prizes of which he
was in possession of woud be of little profitt if taken by Us for we
coud only Come in for a share w'ch woud be allow'd Us by the Court,
and that perhaps woud not make Good a Limb if it was Lost, also that
We had not hands Sufficient to Man them, and to bring those Vessells
to providence. no one was able to buy any part of them and to Carry
them to the No'ward woud be the breaking up of the Voyage without
profitt. Nevertheless We Lett the Sloop Come alongside Us and Received
her Shott. We Gave her a broadside and a Volley of Small Arms with
three Huzas, then bore down to the Ship, who all this time had been
pelting Us with her Shot but to no purpose, and Gave her another broad
Side which did her some damage, for she bore down to the Sloop and
never fired one more Shott, but Gott her on the Careen and men over
the Side to Stop her holes, also Severall hands att her Rigging to
mend it, her Sails being full of Shott holes, as also those of the
Sloop. All the damage we Gott was One Shott through Our Main Sail. The
Ship mounted 6 Guns of a Side and the Sloop 8. She was a Spanish
privateer that had been Cruizing to the No'ward and had taken 5 Ships
and that Sloop which We took some time before.<a name="FNanchor_50_1022" id="FNanchor_50_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_1022" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It Grieved Us to
think that that felow shoud Go off with those prizes which he woud not
have done had the Capt. been as willing as We. This battle was fought
in the Latitude 29.26, Longt. 74:30 W. but no blood Shed on Our Side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span></p>

<p><i>Munday 10th.</i> Fine breeze of Wind att NW. with a large Sea. att 5 AM.
Saw Hog Island<a name="FNanchor_53_1025" id="FNanchor_53_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_1025" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and the Island of providence. att 8 a pilott boat

Jeremiah Harman Mas'r of Our prize Came also off. he Arrived the day

her with Seven Guns and she Returned Us five. We Run aGround and lay
some time off of Major Stewarts House. The Man of War Send is [sent
his] boat to Cary out an Anchor for Us, so We Gott off. The Capt. Went
ashoar to wait on his Excellency<a name="FNanchor_54_1026" id="FNanchor_54_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_1026" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and send the pinnace off for the
prisoners, who Imediatly were put in Jail. Our prize sent Us two Hogs
which we Imediatly Killed.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday 11th.</i> This day begun to Unload our prize. made a present to
the Governour of Our Horse and Deer. Landed 138 bbs. of provisions,

<p><i>Thursday 13th.</i> Landed all our Corn and made a Clear hole of the
prize. att 9 PM. it begun to thunder and Lighting very hard. Our Sloop
Received great damage by a thunder bolt that struckt our Mast and
Shivered it very much, tore a large peice off of the hounds and as it
fell tore up the bitts<a name="FNanchor_56_1028" id="FNanchor_56_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_1028" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and broke in the hatchway, burst through
both our Sides, and Started the plancks under her whale,<a name="FNanchor_57_1029" id="FNanchor_57_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_1029" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> melting
several Cutlashes, pistolls, and fired off several Small Arms, the
bullets of which stuck in her beam. It was some time before we
perceived that she Leakd, being all thunder Struck, the Master
stepping over the Side to Examine her put his foot on a planck that
was Started on the Larboard side, and all this time the water was
pouring it [in]. we Immediatly brought all Our Guns on the Starboard
Side to Give her a heel and Sent the boat ashoar for Our Doctor, a Man
being hurt by the Lighting, Wm. Jackson. when we Gott her on a heel we
tryed the pumps, not being able to do it before, for our Carefull
Carpenter had ne'er a pump-box Rigg'd nor fitt to work so had it not
been for the Kind assistance of the Man of warr's people, who hearing
of Our misfortune ashoar Came immediatly off and put Our Guns on board
the prize, we must Certainly have Sunk, most of Our hands being
ashoar. This day James Avery Our Boatswain was turned out for neglect
of duty and Ralph Gouch put in his Room.</p>

Offered his Assistance in all he Cou'd and Spared Us his Carpenter who
view'd the Mast and said he thought he coud make it do again. The
Capt. hearing of a peice of timber for his purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span> waited on his
Excellency to desire him to lay his Command on Mr. Jno. Thompson<a name="FNanchor_59_1031" id="FNanchor_59_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_1031" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>

<p><i>Tuesday 18th.</i> We Gott out Our mast and Sent it ashoar to Gett it
fisht and make it fitt for the Cruize.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 19.</i> Att 10 AM. the Court being opened and the Libell Read
I beg'd Leave of his Honour to be heard, which being Granted I spoke
as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>May it please Your Honr.</p>

<p>As there is no Advocate appointed by this Hon'ble Court too
Appear in behalf of the Captures<a name="FNanchor_60_1032" id="FNanchor_60_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_1032" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> of a Sloop that was
taken by Don Pedro Estrado July the 5th, belonging to some
of his Majestys Subjects of Great Britain or Ireland, and
Retaken by Capt. Benj'n Norton and Comp'y in a private Sloop
of War Called the <i>Revenge</i> July the 28th, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span> brought into
this Court for Condemnation, As Capt. QMr. I appear in
behalf of the Owners, Capt. and Comp'y to prove that the
said Sloop and Cargo togather with the three Mollattos and
one Negro, all Slaves belonging to some of the Vessells or
Subjects of the King of Spain, ought to be Condemned for the
benefit and Use of the Captures as aforesd.</p>

<p>I'm Certain I'm Undertaking a taske no ways Qualifyed for
it, But as I have Leave to speak in a Court instituted by
the Laws of England and before a Judge whom Im Certain is
Endued with the strictest Honour and Justice I dont doubt
that if through Ignorance I shoud omit any proof that woud
be of advantage to Us Your Honour will be so Good as to Aid
and Assist me in it.</p>

<p>It will be needless, I believe, S'r, to bring any further
proof than what has been already bro't and Sworn too in
Court to prove the Right and power we had in Seizing this
Sloop and Cargo on the high Seas and bringing of her here
for Condemnation. There is a Late Act of parliament made in
the 12 y'r of his present Majestys Reign,<a name="FNanchor_61_1033" id="FNanchor_61_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_1033" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> wherein it
says that all Vessells belonging to his Majestys Subjects of
Great Britain or Irel'd that shall be taken by the Ennemy
and have been in their possession the Space of 96 hours if
Retaken by any private man of War the Captures shall be
Intituled to the one half for Salvage free from all Charges.
As this [h]as been fully proved in Court that the time the
Ennemy [h]as had her in possession is above 96 hours I dont
doubt but the one half free of all Charges will be allotted
Us for Salvage.</p>

<p>The thing in dispute is the three Mollatos and one Negro,
all Slaves taken on board the prize, said to belong to some
of Vassalls or Subjects of the King of Spain and is by this
Court put to Us too prove they are so, which hope to do by
some Circumstances and the Insufficiency of the Evidence in
their favour which amounts to nothing more than hearsay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span></p>

<p>The first Evidence in their favour is that of John Evergin,
a Native of No.Carolina,<a name="FNanchor_62_1034" id="FNanchor_62_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_1034" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> who professes himself to be a
Child of the Spirit, who for the Value of a Share in April
last having been taken prisoner by the said Don Pedro
Estrado and brought to St. Augustine did Consent to pillott
them in the Bowells of his Native Country and betrayed them
to that Cruel and Barbarous Nation. Can Your Honour Confide
in a Man who has betrayed his Countrymen, Robbed them of
their Lives and also what are dearer to them their Liberty,
One who has Exposed his Bretheren to Eminent Dangers and
Reduced them and their familys to Extream wants by fire and
Sword? Can the Evidence, I say, of so vile a Wretch who has
forfeited his Leige to his King by Entring in the Ennemys
Service, and unnaturally sold his Countrymen, be of any
weight in a Court of Justice? No, Im Certain, and I hope it
will meet with None to prove that these Slaves are freemen
for all that he as [has] said as he owns was only but
hearsay. The other Evidence is of a Villain of another Stamp
a French Runnagado, Juan Baptist Domas. his Evidence is so
Contrary to the Questions askt Francisco and Aug'ne that I
hope it will meet with the same fate as the first deserves
not to be Regarded. I'll own he has sworn to it, but how? On
a peice of a Stick made in the shape of a thing they name a
Cross, Said to be blest and Sanctyfyed by the poluted words
and hands of a wretched priest, a Spawn of the whore of
Babylon, who is a Monster of Nature and a Servant to the
Devill, Who for a Riall will pretend to absolve them from
perjury, Incest and parricide, and Cannonize them for
Cruelties Committed to we Herreticks, as they stile us, and
Even Rank them in the Number of those Cursed Saints who by
their Barbarity have Rendered their Names Immortall and
Odious to all true Beleivers. tis by such Devills they Swear
and to them they pray. Can then Your Hon'r Give Credit to
such Evidence, who no doubt they had agreed between them
that he should swear they were free, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span> he might Easily
do, for no Question but they told him so: and to swear it
was but a trifle when absolution Can be Gott so cheap. It
does not stand to Reason that Slaves who are in hopes of
Getting their freedom wou'd own they are so. Does not their
Complextion and features tell all the world that they are of
the blood of Negroes and have suckt Slavery and Cruelty from
their Infancy? Can any one think when we Call to mind that
barbarous Action Committed to his Majestys Brave Subjects
att the Retaken of the fort att St. Augustine, Occasioned by
the treachery of their Vile Gen'l who Sacrificed them to
that Barbarous Colour, that it was done by any that had the
Least drop of blood Either of Liberty or Christianity in
them? No, Im Confident Your Hon'r cant think so, No not Even
of their Gov'r under whose vile Commission this was Suffered
to be done and went unpunisht Headed by this Francisco that
Cursed Seed of Cain, Curst from the foundation of the world,
who has the Impudence to Come into Court and plead that he
is free. Slavery is too Good for such a Savage, nay all the
Cruelty invented by man will never make amends for so vile a
proceeding and if I may be allowed to Speak freely, with
Submission, the torments of the world to Come will not
Suffice. God forgive me if I Judge Unjustly. What a
miserable State must a Man be in who is Under the
Jurisdiction of that vile and Cruel Colour. I pity my poor
fellow Creatures, whom many have been made prisoners this
War and some lately that have been sent to the Avanah, and
all by the treachery of that vile fellow John Evergin who
says he's posse'd with the Spirit of the Inward man but was
possessed with the Spirit of Belzebub when he pillotted the
Cursed Spaniards over the barr of Obricock as it has been
proved in Court.</p>

<p>I dont doubt but this Tragical Act Acted att St. Augustine
has Reacht home before now. This Case may perhaps travell as
farr. when they'l Remember the Sufferings of their
Countrymen Under the Command of this Francisco whom we have
Gott in possession with some of his Comp'y who were
Concern'd with him and Under his Command in that inhuman
fact they will agree no doubt, as I hope Your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span> Honour will,
that they must be Slaves and no others Concern'd in it, So
hope that by the Contradictions which has been shewn in
Court Concerning this Juan Baptista Domas, who affirms he
never saw them till on board the privateer, and Francisco
and Aug'ne both woud prove that they knew him some months
before and Converst with him, is proof Enough they are
Slaves and hope that by the old Law of Nations, where it
Says that all prisoners of War, nay Even their posterity are
Slaves, that by that Law Pedro Sancho and And'w Estavie will
be decreed as Such for the Use of the Captures. So shall
Rest it with your Hon'r.</p>
</div>

<p>Then the Judge Gave his Decree that the Sloop and Cargo shoud be sold
att Vandue and the one half thereof shoud be p'd the Captures for
Salvage, free from all Charges, that Juan Baptisto Domas, Pedro Sanche
and And'w Estavie, According to the Laws of England shoud Remain as
prisoners of War till Ransomed, And that Augustine and Francisco
according to the Laws of the plantations shoud be Slaves and for the
use of the Captures. So the Court broke up.</p>

<p><i>Thursday 20th.</i> Opened a bb. of beef. This day the Vandue begun. Sold
46 bbs. of pork, 29 bb. of Beef and 110 bus. of Corn, then Adjourn'd
it till the next day att 8 of the Clock.</p>

<p><i>Friday 21.</i> This day made an End of Selling the Cargo of the prize.
Sold 55 bus. of corn, 41 bbs. of pork, 6 bb. of beef, 13 bbs. of Tarr,
11 bbs. of pitch, 4 bbs. of Oyle. then Sett up Seignior Capt.
Fransisco Under the Name of Don Blass who was Sold to Mr. Stone for 34
ps. 8. In the height of Our Sail some of the Soldiers Stole a bb. of
pork but was found out before it was all Expended so that one half was
Returned which makes the half bb. as per Acct. of Sales. Viz. Pork and
beef very much damnifyed.</p>

Brig'ne to the Avanah which he had taken in the Latitude 26
No. Coming from Barbadoes Bound to Boston with Rum, Sugar
and Some Baggs of Cotton. We had the pleasure to meet him
Early in the morning and Gave her Chase. when within a mile
of her we hoisted Our pennant. she Imediatly Returned the
Compliment with her Ensign att Mast-head and a Gunn to
Confirm it. we Received Severall Shott from her and

Crowding all the Sail she Cou'd, and we doing the Like Came
again within Gun-Shott and plyed her with Our Bow Chase

she kept pelting of Us with her Stern Chase out of her

the privateer was wounded in the Arm and the bone fractured,
One Negro boy Killed and others wounded. He was fitted out
last Novem'r att the Avanah and went to St. Aug'ne and was
on Our Coast Early in the Spring and took severall Vessells
as per list herein inclosed. he was again fitted out in
August last and had been on the Coast again and had taken
Severall more Vessells, as you will Observe by the Acct.,
but we had the Good fortune to Stop his Cruize. Is Name is

with Sundry Goods that has Rec'd some damage, which must
desire You to Unload directly and take Care to Gett them
dryed. there is also a Negro Boy that is Sickly, a Negro Man
said to be taken off of Barmudas by the privateer as he was
a fishing, and a Mollatto belonging to Some of the Subjects
or Vassalls of the King of Spain, all which We Recomend to
Your Care that they may not Elope. the Number of Spanish
prisoners taken on board is 48, out of which is Eleven of
the blood of Negroes, The Capt. Included, for which we dont
doubt having his Majestys bounty mony, which is &pound;5 Ster. per

till Our Arrivall but only Unloaded and a Just Acct. taken
of what on board. As to the Brigantine, the Capt. of her,
whom we put in again out of Civility, has Used Us in a Very
Rascally manner, for he Run away with the Vessell from Us in
the Night and no doubt with a design to Cheat Us of Our
Salvage, which is the one half of Brig and Cargo, the Enemy
having had possession of her 22 days. As she is a Vessell of
Value, hope You'l do Your Endeavours to Re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>cover Our Just

<p>As this will Require a Law Suit I hope You'l Gett the best
Advice You possibly Can and Gett her Seized if att Boston or

Consign'd to You and the Master Sent on board to take

this account. It will be seen that &pound;1776 16s. 9d. New England currency

That would be reckoning 18s. of New England paper money to the dollar,
or about 20s. 6d. to the ounce of silver. But in 1741 the rate of
depreciation was certainly much higher. In January of that year
Governor Ward of Rhode Island reports to the Board of Trade, "that for
these six years last past, bills have continued to be equal to silver
at twenty-seven shillings per ounce". <i>Col. Recs. R.I.</i>, V. 13. And

behalf of himself and Benjamin Norton, Owners of a Privateer Sloop
Called the <i>Revenge</i>, and as Agent for and in behalf of the Officers
and Mariners Belonging to sd Sloop, Humbly Sheweth to your Honour that
the Said Vessell, Under the Command of said Benjamin Norton, Manned
With Sixty Men, Officers and Marriners, Sailed Out on a Cruize from
Newport in Rhode Island Against the Spaniards in June last, and in the
Latitude of Thirty Degrees North, About Twenty Leagues from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
Havannah, near the Island of Cuba, they met with a Spanish Privateer
of Six Carriage Guns and ten Swivel Guns, with men Answerable, On or
about the 26th day of September last, which Privateer had About
Fourteen days before that taken a Briganteen called the <i>Sarah</i>, with
her Cargo, Consisting of Ten Hogsheads of Barbadoes Rum, Sixteen
Hogsheads of Brown Sugar, Sundry Bales of Cotten, Being in all about
One Ton and a half, together with Ten Barrells of Sugar and About
Twenty barrells of Limes, Altogether of the Value of Five thousand
Pounds in Publick Bills of Credit Usually Current here, which Vessell
was Owned by John Tyler and Thomas Lee, Subjects of the Crown of Great
Britain and now Resident in this Place, as was also part of the said
Cargo as Enumerated, the Rest belonging to Other Subjects Liveing also
at Boston but Unknown to the Complainant, and the said Sloop <i>Revenge</i>
Engaged and took the said Spanish Privateer and at the Same time
Retook the said Briganteen And Cargo and Redeemed the master, whose
name is Thomas Smith, and his Hands, from the Power of the Spaniards,
and for that the said Briganteen And Cargo had been at Such time a
fortnight in the hands of the Spaniards as their Prize, the said
Benjamin Norton put one of his hands aboard and Order'd the said
Vessell to proceed directly to Newport To be Restored to the Owners
upon paying as Salvage One Moiety of said Briganteen and her Cargo,
pursuant to an Act of Parliament Made and Passed in the 13th year of
the Reign of his Present Majesty King George the Second Entituled an
Act for the more Effectual Secureing and Encourageing the Trade of His
Majesties &mdash;&mdash; British Subjects to America and for the Encouragement
of Seamen to Enter into his Majesties Service,<a name="FNanchor_2_1077" id="FNanchor_2_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1077" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Whereby Amongst
Other things It is Provided and Enacted to the following purpose and
Effect, vizt. that the Vessells and Goods of British Subjects
Surprized and Retaken from the Enemy, if by a Private man of War
Commissioned properly thereto, In Case the Vessell and Cargo had been
Above Ninety Six hours in the Possession of the Enemy that took the
same, then to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span> Adjudged To be Restored to the Owners, they paying
for and in Lieu of Salvage One full Moiety or half part of said
Vessell and Goods so taken And Restored, without any deduction
Whatsoever, as in and by the said Act, Reference thereto being had,
more fully may Appear. Now So it is that notwithstanding said
Briganteen and Cargo had been taken as A Prize by said Spanish
Privateer and in their possession as such For twelve or Fourteen days
before she was Retaken by the said Benjamin Norton, who was properly
Commissioned thereto in said Sloop <i>Revenge</i>, yet the said Thomas
Smith, to Defeat the said Act And deprive the said Compl't<a name="FNanchor_3_1078" id="FNanchor_3_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1078" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> together
with said Norton and Crew of their Right and due as Abovesaid,
Contrary to the mind of One Jeremiah Harman who was on purpose left in
said Briganteen to Proceed therein and Assert their Right that
Surprized and Retook her, Yet the said Thomas instead of Proceeding to
Newport as intended Came in said Vessell and with the Aforesaid Cargo
to this Port of Boston, Where they Arrived in Safety in said
Briganteen and with the Aforesaid Cargo on or about the 23d day of
October 1741, and haveing turned the Said Jeremiah on shore have
Unladed and Delivered the said Briganteen Of her Cargo and Effects and
is now Preparing to send with the Owners Consent Or go with the said
Briganteen on a New Voyage Directly, without haveing Obtained Any
Decree of this Court as the Act directs or made Application therefore,
nor will the said Master Thomas Smith and Owners, tho' requested, pay
and give the said Moiety of the Vessell and Cargo so Retaken or any
part thereof to the Complainant For the Uses and purposes abovesaid.
Wherefore this being of a Maratime nature and regarding a Vessell and
Cargo retaken on the High Seas, Expressly falls within the
Jurisdiction of this Hono'ble Court. It's therefore pray'd your honour
will cause the said Vessell and Cargo so Retaken to be Seized and Kept
in the hands of the Marshall till a final Decree may be made on the
premises Pursuant to Said Act, and that the said Thomas Smith, John
Tyler and Thomas Lee may be Summoned in Case they or any of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span> them see
fit to Appear and Answer this Complaint, and that the Complainant may
Obtain for the Uses and Purposes aforesaid your Honours Decree for One
Full Moiety or half part of said Brigantine and her Cargo or be
Otherwise Relieved in the Premises, as your Hon'r shall Judge meet.

<p>Jeremiah Hariman of Lawfull Age Testifyeth and saith that on or about
the latter end of June or the beginning of July last he sailed from
New York In a Privateer Sloop Called <i>The Revenge</i> Commanded by Capt.
Norton on a Cruize Against the Spaniards and in the month of Sept'r
last in the Old Streights of Bahama<a name="FNanchor_2_1080" id="FNanchor_2_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1080" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> they saw a Sloop laying too
with a Jib Sheet to Windward And the Goose wing<a name="FNanchor_3_1081" id="FNanchor_3_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1081" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of her mainsail
hauled up and her foresail hauled down, Upon which We gave her Chase
and upon Comeing within Gun shot of us she Hoisted a Spanish Flagg
upon her Topmast head and fired a shot which went thr'o the Rigging,
upon which we stood After her and upon Comeing within Muskett shot of
said sloop she fired at us again, upon which we hoisted An English
Pendant Upon the Topmast head and then we Engaged her, And in about
two hours and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span> half we took her and found a Spanish Commission On
board her and then we took Out of the Spanish Privateer about fourteen
Spaniards and put them on board Our Sloop and put some of Our men
aboard The Spanish Sloop and then both Sloops gave Chase to the
Brigantine and In about three or four hours Our sloop came up with the
Briganteen and fired One or two Guns, upon which she brought too and
struck and then we took possession Of her, at which time this Depon't
was Credibly Informed as well by Capt. Smith as his men and all
Concern'd that she had been taken as a Prize by The Spaniards and Kept
in their Custody Eleven days before she was Retaken By them, Whereupon
the Quarter master and One hand more went on board the Said Briganteen
to take possession of her as a Retaken Vessell. Capt. Norton Then
Ordered Capt. Smith on board his Own Brig't with his Company, and This
Depon't was also Ordered by the Quarter master and Company of the
<i>Revenge</i> Sloop to go on board said Briganteen to Secure and look
after their Interest, With Orders to keep them Company Untill some
farther Disposition shou'd be Made, which was Intended to be done the
next day, but so it happened by Some Misadventure or Contrivance to
this Depon't unknown they never Coul'd come up with the Sloops again
(th'o they had Severall times sight of Them), Whereupon the said Smith
and Company Alledging they shou'd be short Of Provisions Steer'd their
Course towards Rhoad Island and in About Eight days After, in the
Gulph of Florida,<a name="FNanchor_4_1082" id="FNanchor_4_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1082" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> we Came up with a large Merchant man as deep
Laden as she Cou'd well Swim, she Standing in For the Westward and we
being very near the florida shore Cou'd not Weather her and when she
came up with us she fired a shot Over us, Upon which we brought too
and then Ordered us to Come on board them In Our boat, but upon our
telling them we had no boat they sent their Boat on board us with
their Pilot and Severall Others, who staid on board That night and the
next day. about the midle of the Afternoon they Left us After haveing
plundered the Brig't of One barrell of Sugar, three Small Sails, a
Sheet and Small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span> Anchor, the sheet Cable<a name="FNanchor_5_1083" id="FNanchor_5_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1083" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Sundry Small Stores of
little or no Value. Whereupon Capt. Smith took upon him to Order The
Brigantine to Boston, Capt. Smith at the same time telling this
Depon't He shou'd have mates Wages, And upon their passage Comeing
near Block Island, Capt. Smith refus'd to go into Rhoad Island th'o
Requested by the Depon't And Afterwards they put into Martha's
Vineyard, where Capt. Smith Sold Rum and Other things to Cloath his
people and then made his best Way for Boston where they arrived on or
about the 23d of October last When they discharged this Depon't as

also some Sugar, Rum, Cotton, Wool, two coils of Rigging, and Sundry
Stores Particularly mentioned in a Schedule, Lodged in Court, and also
took of the said Briganteens Cargo five packets of Cotton, two

Haveing at first determined to set her on fire) as also the Remains of

Eight Teirces of Sugar, belonging to the Owners of said Briganteen,

desired to enter on board said Ship, Giveing for reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span> that he Was a

<p>The Case was then fully debated by the Advocates<a name="FNanchor_2_1091" id="FNanchor_2_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1091" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on both sides and
on the Seventh of Decemb'r Aforesaid his Honour the Judge gave the
following Decree, vizt.</p>

<p>This Case on the Evidence Appears to me shortly to stand thus: On the
17th day of Sept'r last the Briganteen <i>Sarah</i> in her Passage from
Barbadoes to Boston was taken by a Spanish Privateer. on the 26th of
said Month Capt. Norton in an English Privateer took the Spaniard and
his said Prize, puts one of his hands on board of the Briganteen and
Continues Mr. Smith the Master and his Crew belonging to her on board,
Ordering him to keep him Com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>pany and Proceed to Rhoad Island, but the
Briganteen Not being Able to keep up with the English Privateer lost
sight of her, And in her Passage for Rhoad Island on the 4th of
October was again taken By a Spanish ship, who plundered her the
second time and Carrying with them the Mate, One hand and a Boy, on
the 5th of October Aforesaid was prevail'd upon to Give the Briganteen
with the Remains of her Cargo, etc. to the said Smith the Master, who
brought her to Boston, and now the Owners of the English Privateer and
Capt. Norton and his Crew demand one half for Salvage according to the
Stat. In that Case (as they say) provided, and if they are Entitled to
the Same is the Sole Question. In determining of which I shall Premise</p>

<p>1st. Its a Rule in Law that the Right of Changeing Property by force
of Arms is so Odious that in the takeing of Goods if by any
Possibility The Right Owner may have Restitution the same shall be
done, and th'o a Larger time than twenty four hours happen between the
Capture And Recapture, and so may pernoctare<a name="FNanchor_3_1092" id="FNanchor_3_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1092" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> with the Captor yet
Restitution may be made.</p>

<p>2 ly. The Sense and Understanding the Law hath of Privateers, vizt.
That they Are such as receive no pay but go to war at their Own
charge, and Instead of pay leave is granted to Keep what they can take
from the Enemy, and alth'o such License is Granted yet may they not of
their Own heads Convert to their Private use Prizes before the same
have Been Adjudged by Law Lawfull to the Captors.</p>

<p>3 ly. There are Two Adjudged Cases that may Contribute to the Clearing
up this Point. The First is in the War between England and Holland.<a name="FNanchor_4_1093" id="FNanchor_4_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1093" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
a Dutch man of war takes an English Merchant man and Afterwards an
Eng<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>lish man of war Meets the Dutchman of war and his Prize and in
Aperto Prelio<a name="FNanchor_5_1094" id="FNanchor_5_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1094" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> regains the Prize. there Restitution is made, the
Owners paying Salvage, <i>for had it been a Lawfull Prize to the
Recaptor the Admiral wou'd have had a Tenth</i>. The Second is where a
Ship Chartered in his Voyage happens to be taken By An Enemy, and
Afterwards in Battle is Retaken by Another ship in Amity, And
Restitution is made and she proceeds on her Voyage. the Contract is
not Determined. th'o the taken<a name="FNanchor_6_1095" id="FNanchor_6_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1095" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> by the Enemy divested the Property
out of the Owners, Yet by the Law of War the Possession was
defeazable, and being Recovered by battle Afterwards, the Owners
became Reinvested, so the Contract by [fiction] of Law became as if
she never had been taken and so the Entire freight Became due.</p>

<p>Lastly, I Observe the Words of the Stat. in the Case of Recaption<a name="FNanchor_7_1096" id="FNanchor_7_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1096" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Agree with the Words of the Law in the Cases put, for the words In the
Act are <i>shall be adjudged to be Restored to Such former Owner, etc.
Paying in Lieu of Salvage, etc.</i></p>

<p>These things thus Premised I Come to the Consideration of the Point
before me, and am of Opinion the Prepon'ts are Not Entituled to Any
Salvage, for that the Owners were never Absolutely Divested of their
Property, as may fairly be Collected from what has been Before
mentioned. Its true the Prepon'ts had a Right or Claim to Salvage On
the Recaption, but before that right Cou'd be Adjudged lawfull to the
Recaptors the Briganteen was again taken by a Spaniard, which puts an
Entire End to Salvage for a former Recaption, because Retakeing and
Restitution begets Salvage but the Prepon'ts Retakeing is lost by the
Enemies Again takeing the Brig't, and in Fact its the Enemy that made
the Restitution. Therefore I decree the said Libel to stand dismist,
but inasmuch as the Prepon'ts have been in Part Instrumental towards
the Preservation of the said Briganteen and th'o not Strictly Speaking
by Law Entituled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span> to Salvage and the Case being New, I decree the
Def'ts to pay all the Costs.<a name="FNanchor_8_1097" id="FNanchor_8_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1097" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

referred to may be one of the two, those of the <i>Laurel Tree</i> and the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_1097" id="Footnote_8_1097"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_1097">[8]</a> From this decree of Judge Auchmuty the owners of the
<i>Revenge</i> appealed (see docs. no. <a href="#DOC_151">151-158</a>), but in vain. Opinions
might well differ, as did those of the civilians consulted in London,
<a href="#DOC_153">doc. no. 153</a>. High authorities declared that when a prize had been
taken into firm and secure possession, the title of the original
proprietor was completely extinguished, and was not revived by a
recapture (The <i>Ceylon</i>, 1 Dodson 105). But as to English practice,
the civilians of Doctors' Commons certified in 1678 that the custom of
the High Court of Admiralty was to restore the recaptured vessel to
the first proprietor, with salvage of one-eighth to the recaptors
(Marsden, <i>Law and Custom of the Sea</i>, II. 102, <i>cf.</i> also 168, 193),
and the statute 13 Geo. II. ch. 4, sect. 18, so provides, with
enlargement of salvage when the enemy's possession had lasted longer;
see <a href="#DOC_145">doc. no. 145</a>, <a href="#Footnote_61_1033">note 61</a>. But this present case was, or purported to
be, a case of a <i>second</i> recapture. A note in 4 Chr. Robinson 217
shows three cases in 1778, 1780, and 1781, of British prizes
recaptured by the French, then captured again by the British; in one
case the House of Lords awarded the vessel to the first captor, in the
other two to the last. Justice Story, in one of his notes in 2
Wheaton, app., p. 46, says, "Where a hostile ship [<i>e.g.</i>, Smith's
brigantine when first encountered by Norton, in Spanish hands] is
captured, and afterward is recaptured by the enemy, and is again
recaptured from the enemy, the original captors [<i>e.g.</i>, Norton] are
not entitled to restitution on paying salvage, but the last captors
[<i>e.g.</i>, Smith] are entitled to all the rights of prize, for, by the
first recapture, the whole right of the original captors is devested";
and he refers to the <i>Astrea</i> (1 Wheaton 125), where Marshall in 1816
so decided, with as much emphasis as Sir Leoline Jenkins laid on an
opposite doctrine in 1672. In 1741 doctrine was in transition from the
earlier to the later view.</p></div>

<p class="center">CASE.</p>

<p>The English Brigantine called the <i>Sarah</i>, Thomas Smith Master,
together with her Cargo, consisting of Rum, Sugar, Cotton and money on
Board, was in her Passage from Barbadoes taken and Seized by a Spanish
Privateer mounted with Sixteen Guns and Manned with upwards of Forty
Men, who took out of the said Brigantine all the Money, but Continued
all the rest of her Cargo on board of her, and the Spanish Privateer
ordered and Caused the Master and Four of the Brigantine's Men to be
put on Board the Privateer and put some of the Privateers Men on Board
the Brgt. and turned her Long Boat adrift and the Brigantine was
Ordered to keep Company with the Privateer and Steer for the Havannah.
About Twenty Leagues from the Havannah, near the Island of Cuba, an
English Privateer Sloop called the <i>Revenge</i> (Benjamin Norton Commr.)
came up with the said Spanish Privateer in Company with the said
Brigantine, Engaged and took the Said Spanish Privateer and at the
same time retook the said English Brigantine and Cargo on board, and
Capt. Norton then took all the Spaniards out of the said Spanish
privatr. and English Brigantine and put them on board his own
Privateer, and Ordered Thomas Smith, the Master, and Crew of the said
English Brigantine from on Board the Spanish Privateer to be put on
Board the said Brigantine, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span> the same time put on Board her
Jeremiah Harimen, One of his own Privateer's Crew, to keep Possession
of her until Salvage Shd. be paid for the Recapture, at the same time
with Orders to keep the Privateer Company and proceed to Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Soon after, either by the Contrivance of Thos. Smith, the Master of
the Brigantine, or by the Wind blowing fresh, the Brigantine was
Seperated or lost Sight of the Privateer.</p>

<p>The Brigantine met with a Spanish Ship Mounted with six Guns and
Navigated with about 25 Men, who boarded the Brigantine and Plundred
her and took out of her part of her Rigging, Sails, Cables and
Anchors, and part of her Lading, and the next day they quitted her,
but first took out of her the Mate, One hand and a Boy, and put them
on Board their Spanish Merchant Ship and carried them away.</p>

<p>Capt. Smith afterwards proceeded with the said Brigantine and in her
Passage coming near Block Island was desired by Jeremiah Harimen (who
was put on board to keep Possession of her as a fore said) to go into
Rhode Island but refused the same and proceeded to Boston, where upon
her arrival the said Jeremiah Harimen was put out of possession of
her, and Thos. Smith, the Master, Caused her Cargo to be unloaded and
delivered and afterwards to be refitted, without the Least offering to
pay any Salvage, under pretence that the Master of the Spanish Mercht.
Ship after plundering the Brigantine gave the same to the said Thos.
Smith the Master.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Commr. and Owners of the English Privateer caused the
said Ship to be arrested in the Vice Admiralty Court of Boston to
Answer the said Salvage.</p>

<p>Pleas were given and Admitted and Several Witnesses Exd. on both
sides, and the Judge of Vice Admiralty dismissed the Cause without
giving any Salvage whatsoever, from which Decree it is Appealed on the
behalf of the Comr. and Owners of the said English Privateer.</p>

<p><i>Observe.</i> By the Depo[sitio]ns of the Witnesses there Appears to be
some Variation relating to the Seizure of the Brigantine by the
Spanish Mercht. Ship. Thos. Smith, Mas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>ter of the Brigantine, and his
Mariners Swear that the Spanish Mercht. Man after seizing and
plundering her gave him the Ship.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Hariman, who was put on board by the English Privateer in
Order to keep Possesn. of her, differs from them in his depo[sitio]ns.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i><a name="FNanchor_2_1102" id="FNanchor_2_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1102" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Are not the Owners and Comr. of the English Privateer intitled
to a Moiety of the said Brigantine and her Lading for Salvage by
reason the Brigantine was in Possessn. of the Spanish Privateer above
96 hours before she was retaken, and whether they have not Just Cause
of Appeal.</p>

<p>If Capt. Norton, the Commander of the English Privateer, after having
retaken the Brigantine from the Spanish Privateer, had kept possession
of her, and Carried her safe into a British port, he and his Owners
would have been entitled to Salvage, According to the Directions of
the Act of Parliament. But as the Brigantine was afterwards taken by
another Spanish Ship, before she got into Port, and not protected
against the Enemy by Capt. Norton, it seems to me very doubtful
whether he can Claim the Salvage According to the Act of Parliament,
For Salvage is understood to be a Reward to the Recaptor, who has not
only rescued the Ship and Cargo out of the hands of the Enemy, but has
also effectually Secured the same for the benefit of the Owners, till
the safe Arrival of the Ship in a British Port, Which not having been
done in the present Case, makes me doubt of Success in an Appeal from
the Sentence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctrs Commons</span>, May 17, 1742.</p>

<p><br />According to the Evidence given in this Case I am of Opinn. that the
Brigantine the <i>Sarah</i>, being taken the 17th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span> of Septemr. 1741 by a
Spanish Privateer in a voyage from Barbados, and retaken on the 26th
of Septemr. 1741 by the Privateer the <i>Revenge</i> from Rhode Island,
commanded by Capt. Norton, and convey'd to Boston, The Captain of the
Privateer the <i>Revenge</i> will be well entitled to Salvage for the
Brigantine and her cargo, and the said vessel having been 96 Hours in
possession of the Spaniards, the <i>Revenge</i> Privatr. will be well
entitled to a Moiety of the value of Ship and Cargo.</p>

<p>The said Brigantine being seiz'd on the 4th of October by a Spanish
Merchant Ship and plunder'd will not abate the <i>Revenge's</i> Right to
Salvage. If the Spanish Merchant Ship did actually give the Brigantine
(on the 5th of October at the request of a Spanish Priest) to Mr.
Thomas Smith, that will not barr the Salvage because such Ship could
have no property in the Brigantine. I therefore think that there's
good Reason for an appeal if this Case be truly stated.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dr. Commons</span>, July 10th 1742<br />
Copy
</p>

<p><br />The Right of Salvage acquir'd by the Recapture of the <i>Sarah</i> Brigt.
was not, I conceive, extinguished by its being taken again by the
Spanish Merchant Ship, she not being carried <span xml:lang="la"><i>intra praesidia</i></span>,<a name="FNanchor_5_1105" id="FNanchor_5_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1105" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but
only plundered and let go. The Pretence of a Gift thereof to Captn.
Smith can have no weight, for the Spanish Mercht. acquir'd no property
by the Capture and could transfer none to Smith, who has deliver'd the
Cargo to the Owners and Freighters, to which he would have had as much
right as to the Ship. As the pretended Gift could transfer no
property, it could extinguish no right which had been acquir'd by the
<i>Revenge</i>, Except as to such part of the Cargo as was taken away by
the Spaniard. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span> the Owners and Company of the <i>Revenge</i> are
intitled to a Moiety of the full Value of the Ship and Cargo, as she
arriv'd at Boston, without any Deduction, and I am of Opinion that
there is just ground of Appeal from the Sentence given in the Court of
Admiralty there.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1120" id="Footnote_1_1120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1120">[1]</a> Massachusetts Historical Society. It will be observed
that an appeal was an expensive process; that advocates' fees were
expressed in guineas, multiples of &pound;1. 1s.; that the proctor felt that
he had to have a coach whenever he went to attend one of the sessions
of the court; and that "the law's delays" were abundantly exemplified.
The Lords Commissioners sat in the Council Chamber at the Cockpit in
Whitehall. Their procedure can be gathered from the printed briefs,
for appellant and respondent, which are preserved in a few American
libraries, often bearing manuscript annotations by the lawyers for
whom they were prepared. The Library of Congress has a collection of
such briefs, some 200 in number, 1751-1764, bound in four huge folio
volumes, and still ampler collections for the later wars of the
century, American and French. The library of Brown University has two
such volumes, embracing briefs in forty or fifty cases, 1780-1782.
Another collection, also bound in two volumes, formerly belonging to
Mr. Gordon L. Ford, but now to the New York Public Library, is
described by the late Paul L. Ford in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the
Massachusetts Historical Society, XXV. 85-101, with full data
respecting the twenty-five American cases.</p></div>

their deputy the <i>surrogate</i>, would issue an <i>inhibition</i> to the judge
of the court from which the appeal had come up, enjoining him to stop
all further proceedings, and a <i>monition</i> to transmit all the past
proceedings in the cause to them; these latter documents constituted

in vol. II. of Robert James's <i>Dictionary of Medicine</i> (London, 1745),
extended reference is made to a plaster compounded of ammoniac,

was Freebody and Norton's copy of the agreement. With the aid of
documents found elsewhere, the history of the <i>Success</i> can be pieced
out. Among the records of the vice-admiralty court at Boston there is
a thin book of "Accounts of Sales", which begins with accounts of
sales of the <i>Success</i> and her cargo, July 22-Oct. 7, 1743, from which
it appears that she was a British vessel, recaptured from the enemy by
the privateer bilander <i>Young Eagle</i>, John Rous commander, the same
privateer that brought in the <i>Amsterdam Post</i>, with its former
lieutenant now commander (<a href="#DOC_128">doc. no. 128</a>, <a href="#Footnote_9_922">note 9</a>). Then, in the Rhode
Island archives, "Admiralty Papers, 1726-1745", pp. 63-82, we have the
libel and other papers in the case of James Allen of the <i>Revenge</i> and
Peter Marshall of the <i>Success</i> against the <i>Willem</i> galley (see
<a href="#DOC_161">doc. no. 161</a>), which shows one of the successes of this joint cruise to
have been that, on Mar. 16, 1745, in the Old Bahama Straits, the two
associates took the ship <i>Willem</i>, sailing under Spanish colors and
under the command of Cosme Zeggrayne (Zegarain), but which originally
was a Dutch ship, commanded by Pieter Couwenhoven.</p></div>

Havana privateer on charges of smuggling, was then retaken by the
<i>Revenge</i> and <i>Success</i>, cruising together in consequence of the above
agreement, <a href="#DOC_160">doc. no. 160</a>, carried into Rhode Island, and condemned as a
prize by the vice-admiralty court there. An appeal was taken. The
briefs presented in the case when it came before the Lords

collection of such briefs mentioned in <a href="#Footnote_1_1120">note 1</a> to <a href="#DOC_157">doc. no. 157</a> as
belonging to the New York Public Library, and are described by Mr.
Paul L. Ford in Mass. Hist. Soc., <i>Proceedings</i>, XXV. 99. The question
was, had the <i>Willem</i> become a Spanish ship. The Lords Commissioners
restored it to the appellants, Pieter Couwenhoven and other Dutch
subjects. The respondents were Capt. James Allen and others; one of
their two advocates was Dr. George Hay, afterward Sir George Hay,

did discover, pursue, apprehend and as lawfull Prize did take from the

Sibbald, for himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span> and the other Owners of the sd. Sloop, prays
this hon'ble Court, the premises being proved, That the sd. Snow, Wine
and Negroes may be adjudged and condemned for the Use of the Owners of
the sd. Sloop and other the Captors aforesd. as lawfull Prizes and
Purchase of War according to the Laws Marine, Laws of Nations and
Customs of War.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Sibbald</span>.</p>

<p>Whereupon Proclamation was made, If any one hath ought to say why the
Snow, Wines, etc. in the sd. Libel ment'd ought not to be condemned as
lawfull Prize, let them come forth and they shall be heard. And none
appearing to do this, The Court adjourned till Saturday the 13th inst.
at 10 o'clock.</p>

<p class="center"><i>June 13th.</i> The Court met.</p>

<p>The Libel read and Proclamation made a second time and Juan Milidony,
the late Master of the said Snow, being sent for comes into Court, and
John Jordan and Patrick Orr, Persons well skilled in the Spanish

sd. Milidony as also faithfully and truly to translate all such Papers
relating to the Capture and Prize aforesd. as shall by the direction
of the Court be laid before them for that purpose, as well on the Part
of the Captors as on the Part of the Claimers if any such shall
appear.</p>

<p>The Judge then informed the said Milidony of the Mode of proceeding to
be observed by the Court and ordered all the Papers taken in and with
the said Snow to be produced. Which being done, notwithstanding the
sd. Milidony did not offer or give the Security required of a Claimer
by the Act of Parliament, The Judge permitted him to view and point
out any Papers he pleased in order to satisfy the Court that it was no
lawfull Prize; which he did without alledging or so much as
insinuating the Loss or Embezilment of any Papers.</p>

<p>The Judge then directed that the Preparatory Examina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>tions should be
taken, and translations made of the material Papers in order for
Tryal.</p>

The story of the Spanish or Dutch snow <i>Princess of Orange</i> may be
further illustrated from the pages of Franklin's paper, the
<i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, of Thursday, Apr. 9, 1741. "Friday last
arrived here a Spanish Snow laden with Wine, taken at Aruba, and sent
in by the <i>George</i>, Capt. Drummond, of this Port. She came from
Teneriffe, and had a Pass from the Dutch Consul, but no Dutchmen on
board: On Account of this Pass, the Governor of Curasoa sent out a
Vessel to demand the Prize of Capt. Drummond, but he refus'd to
restore her, fir'd at the Dutchman and beat him off. Before the Taking
of this Snow, Capt Drummond had taken two Sloops, one was sent into
Jamaica and condemn'd there, the other being a good Sailer, he has
fitted out for a Tender, with 30 Men, and Arms suitable, under the
Command of Capt. Sibbald; she is call'd the <i>Victory</i>. On the 16th of
February, the <i>George</i>, the <i>Victory</i>, and the Prize Snow, being in
Company off Hispaniola, were chas'd by two Men of War, which they
suppos'd to be Enemies; the <i>George</i> and <i>Victory</i> left the Prize, and
she was taken; but the <i>Victory</i> falling in with the Grand English
Fleet two Days after, found they were English Men of War, who had
taken the Prize, and she was restor'd to Capt. Sibbald, by Order from
Admiral Vernon. The <i>Victory</i> convoy'd her thro' the Windward Passage,
and return'd to look out for the <i>George</i>, from whom she Parted in the
Chase."
</p><p>
The <i>Gazette</i> of May 28 chronicles the arrival, May 24, of the sloop
<i>Victory</i>, Sibbald, and gives an account of a glorious fight, May 15,
in which Capt. Sibbald, attacked simultaneously by a Spanish ship and
sloop, had beaten both off. His owners rewarded his valor with a
present of a silver-hilted sword. The <i>Gazette</i> of June 4 adds, "This
day arrived the <i>George</i> Privateer, belonging to this Place, from
Jamaica. Capt. Drummond, who commanded her, died on the Passage". See

husband, a sincere friend, and an honest man", so says his tombstone
in Christ Church yard. He had an important part in the privateering
expeditions from Philadelphia in this war. In the <i>Memoirs</i> of Peter
Henry Bruce, chiefly occupied with his service in the Russian army
under Peter the Great, but ending with a narrative of military
engineering services in the Bahamas and South Carolina, that author
gives an account (pp. 403-408, 421) of the capture of two rich Spanish
prizes in September, 1742, "by John Sibbald of the <i>George</i> schooner,
and William Dowall, of the <i>Joseph and Mary</i> sloop, both privateers
from Philadelphia", who brought them into New Providence; and he
vehemently accuses Governor Tinker of defrauding them and their
Philadelphia owners by machinations lasting all through that winter.
"All our Privateers", he adds, "intended to have made this place their
general rendezvous; but the treatment Sibbald and Dowall met with,
prevented any from coming near us". Later, May, 1744, the journal of
William Black shows Dowell as again commander of the <i>George</i>
schooner, 14 carriage and 18 swivel guns, then fitting out in the
Delaware; and in 1746 he commanded the <i>Pandour</i> privateer. <i>Pa. Mag.

away, and came to Boston, and applyed himself to your petitioner
telling him he could Inform him how the Officers of sd. Privateer had
greatly wronged your petitioner, That your petitioner being well
Informed of sd. Louds Actions, Mutinying and Ill behaviour on board
the said Privateer, thought proper not to Shew him any Countenance or
hear any thing he had to Say, whereupon the said William Loud then,
and from time to time Since, hath greatly abused and Insulted your
petitioner, and has vowed and threatned to take revenge on your
petitioner but for what reason he cannot tell.</p>

<p>That your petitioner has been Informed by Several Gentlemen of his
Acquaintance, and is well assured, that sd. Loud has twice in the
night besett your petitioners house, and there waited Several hours,
with others unknown in Order to met your petitioner going in or coming
out, and do him Some bodily hurt or take away his life, which your
petitioner is actually apprehensive of, from the many threatnings of
sd. Loud.</p>

<p>That your petitioner having just reason to fear that his life was in
Eminent danger applyed to Justice of the peace, and Swore the peace
against sd. Loud, but could not prevail upon any Officer to take said
Loud up and carry him before a Justice, and the reason, as your
petitioner thinks, is that they are affraid of him, he said Loud
always appearing armed with a great broad Sword, and a Number of his
Comrades with him, and Seems to bid Defiance to the Government and all
Authority; That your petitioner when he has Occasion to go abroad at
night, or come home to his house is Obliged to get a number of his
friends to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span> with him for fear of being Insulted, abused or killed
by sd. Loud.</p>

<p>That notwithstanding your petitioner obtained Leave from the
Government to beat up for Sailers to man the <i>Young Eagle</i> privateer,
John Rous Commander, now bound on a privateering Voyage, yet the sd.
Wm. Loud in a riotous manner followed the Drum about the Town cursing
and abusing the Captain, and Several times Colloured<a name="FNanchor_2_1217" id="FNanchor_2_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1217" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the
Lieutenant, tho' he had never Seen him before. That the sd. Loud Still
Continues to behave himself in this riotous manner, and to threaten
your petitioner with revenge either to kill your petr. or burn his
house, or both, whereby your petitioner justly thinks his life and
Interest are both in absolute danger from this Loud and his
Associates.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner most humbly prays your Excellency and
honours to take this affair into Consideration and to look into the
two protests herewith presented wch. plainly Shew that sd. Loud was
Ordered on board a Man of warr for his mutinying and Ill behaviour on
board the sd. privateer, And that your Excellency and Honours would
please to Order that sd. Loud may be taken up and put on board one of
his Majestys Ships now in this Port, or otherwise to Order in the
premises, for the relief and Safety of your petitioners person and
Interest, as your Excellency and honours Shall think most proper.</p>

<p>And your Petitioner as in duty bound Shall ever pray, etc.</p>

<p>The Deposition of John Flood and Zachariah Foss who sail'd from Boston
on the 25th of June last in the Privateer <i>Hawk</i>, Samuel Waterhouse
Commander.</p>

<p>The Deponents testifye that being on Board the Brigantine <i>Hawk</i>
commanded by Saml: Waterhouse, They on the 29th of June last, in the
forenoon, betwixt the Hours of Eleven and Twelve, about 40 Leagues to
the South East of Cape Briton, spied a Sloop steering northward, and
observing that she had a White Pennant out<a name="FNanchor_2_1223" id="FNanchor_2_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1223" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> they gave her Chace, and
easily outsaild her and having got within about a Mile of her the
Sloop fir'd a Shot which fell about half a mile to Leeward of the
<i>Hawk</i>, at the same time making all the Sail she could to run from us;
upon which we fired at the Sloop five times successively; our first
and second shot fell to Leeward, The third went thro' her Foresail,
The fourth went thro' both her Mainsail and Foresail, The fifth struck
her forward towards her Bow: upon which we were ordered to bear away,
(being then at the Distance of about forty Pole from her, as near as
we can judge) and as we bore away from the Sloop, we gave her three
Chears (which were return'd us) and fir'd another Gun; The Sloop in
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span> mean time bearing close upon the Wind in order to make her
Escape. within the Space of about an Hour after, the Company in the
<i>Hawk</i> agreeing (all save the Captain and the owners Quartermaster) to
follow the Sloop and Engage her, We gave her Chace, but She having by
that time got to the Distance of about 3 Leagues from Us to windward,
and a thick Fog arising, we lost Sight of her by about four of the
Clock in the afternoon; we however, kept our course in pursuit of her
till the next morning, but saw her not again.</p>

<p>The Deponents further declare that the Number of Hands on Board the
<i>Hawk</i> (including Boys to the number of 10 or 12) was one hundred and
thirty eight; That she had twelve Carriage Guns&mdash;(viz: 2 nine
Pounders, 2 six Pounders, and 8 four Pounders,) beside 20 or 22 Swivel
Guns.</p>

<p>That the Sloop (so far as they could judge) was of not more than half
the number of Tun as the Brigantine <i>Hawk</i>. The Number of her Men they
could not guess at, being in great Measure cover'd by a Netting, which
Surrounded them; Save that they observ'd em to muster thick on the
Quarter Deck. That not coming a Breast with the Sloop, the Deponents
could not discover the Number of her Guns, Save, that mr Flood
imagined that he saw two Carriage Guns on her Larboard side.</p>

<p>The Deponents further declare that they verily believe that had the
Brigantine Engaged the sloop, the former might easily have taken the
latter, and that this was the Opinion of their Company in General.</p>

<p>They further add, that when orders were given for their bearing off
from the Sloop, Capt. Waterhouse declar'd as a reason for so doing
that his owners enjoyn'd him not to Engage with a Privateer. But that
when it was Voted by the Company to pursue the Sloop, he appear'd well
pleas'd that the matter was so over ruled, altho' his orders were
otherwise.</p>

<p>The said Zachariah Foss further adds, that he heard Capt. Waterhouse
say that thenceforward he would take all the Privateers that came in
his way.</p>

<p>The sd Zachariah further declar'd that on the Day be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>fore the <i>Hawk</i>
sail'd from Boston, sundry Gentlemen (whom he took to be her owners)
being on Board, he heard e'm desire Capt. Waterhouse not to Engage any
Privateer, for that the Vessel was not fitted for such a purpose,
adding that should he take a Privateer, they should get nothing by it,
but Rags and Lice and broken Bones.</p>

<p>And the Deponents further say not.</p>

<p>On the Thirteenth day of August Ao. Dom: 1744, And in the Eighteenth
Year of His Majestys Reign Before me Benjamin Pollard<a name="FNanchor_2_1228" id="FNanchor_2_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1228" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Notary and
Tabellion Publick by Royal Authority duly Admitted and sworn dwelling
and practising in Boston in New England Personally Appeared the
several persons whose Names are hereunto Subscribed Sailors belonging
to the Brigantine named the <i>Hawk</i> Called a private Man of Warr
Mounting 12 Carriage and 20 Swivel Guns and Carrying 138 Men Commanded
by Samuel Waterhouse now lying the Harbour of Cape Ann Who Severally
Declared as follows. And First these Appearers say that the said Saml.
Waterhouse in a late Cruize against the French and Spaniards Suffered
a Small French Privateer whose force did not Exceed one third of the
said <i>Hawk</i> and which it was in his Power to have taken without risque
of his Vessell and Company, to escape after firing a few guns, by
Voluntarily Parting from him with a Salute of Three Chears; And on the
Twenty Ninth day of July last the sd. Brigt <i>Hawk</i> being in Consort
with the Sloop <i>Elizabeth</i> a Private Man of Warr belonging to New-York
of About 10 Carriage and 12 Swivel Guns and about 55 Men Commanded by
Thomas Barns about Twelve o'Clock of that day descry'd a ship Standing
to the Westward, the <i>Hawk</i> then Standing to the Eastward upon which
Capt. Waterhouse bore away to the sd. sloop to Consult with Capt.
Barns (who was then to Leward) About Engaging sd. Ship, and Capt.
Barns ask'd what they Made of her, Waterhouse sd. he believed her to
be a 40 Gun Ship, to which Barns answered, if she was an 80 Gun Ship
he would See her, and then they Stood for her, the ship Still keeping
her Course And About an hour before Sun Sett that day gott within
About Three Quarters of a Mile of her, when the <i>Hawk</i> hoisted English
Colours and fired a Nine Pound Shot at her, and the ship hoisted a
French Jack on her Ensign Staff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span> and returned a shot, which fell Short
of the <i>Hawk</i> and after the <i>Hawk</i> had fired About 10 Guns and the
Ship about 17 Guns, Waterhouse Commanded his Company to desist from
firing and to bare away as fast as Possible, and Capt. Barns (who then
lay to Windward by order of sd. Waterhouse) very Much Blamed
Waterhouse's Conduct in leaving her and said that he (Barns) Intended
to have got under her Stern and Raked her fore and aft, and the next
Morning Saw a ship they believed to be the same but Waterhouse would
not follow her but gave Chase to a smaller Vessell Called the <i>St.
John</i> lately taken by him, but Barns was resolved to see her and
accordingly went after her and found it was the Same Ship they had
Engaged over night And further declared That the said Capt. Waterhouse
has been guilty of a Breach of the Articles of Agreement respecting
the said Cruize by rejecting and refusing the Vote of the said
Company, That the said Waterhouse is a Man of a Moross, Froward and
Barbarous disposition having during sd. Cruize used Many of these
appearers very Inhumanely by Confining them in Irons Without any real
Cause, and is Man of no Courage or Resolution daring not to Engage any
Vessell of Equal force with his, but on the Contrary has turned his
back on them, and these appearers verily believe that with the help of
the sd. Sloop (who was Willing to Aid and Assist) the said <i>Hawk</i>
Might have taken the aforesd: Ship, That the sd: Waterhouse Often
declared on board that he had orders not to Engage any Privateer and
that he Came out to take Merchantmen and such as he could run down,
That these appearers have always acted up to their duty in their
respective Capacitys on board said <i>Hawk</i> to the Utmost of their
Power, And for the reasons Aforesaid These Appearers have left the sd.
<i>Hawk</i> in Cape Ann Harbour and Come up to Town and requesting me the
said Notary to Protest against the said Capt. Waterhouse and his
Cowardice, Actings and doings.</p>

<p>Therefore I the said Notary At the request aforesaid did and do hereby
Solemnly Protest against the said Samuel Waterhouse and his Cowardice,
Actings, doings and Misconduct in and about the said Cruize as the
Only reason of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span> these Appearers Coming up to Town, and for all loss,
Costs, Charges, damages and demands Whatsoever, Which they or any of
them Shall or May Suffer Sustain or be put unto by Means thereof, And
Lastly the appearers Declared that they are ready and Willing to go on
board the Said <i>Hawk</i> Privateer and proceed in her on another Cruize
under the Command of any Captain of known Courage and Conduct. Thus
done and Protested in Boston the day and year before written</p>

<p>And To the truth of all which these Appearers have Severally Made Oath
and subscribed their Names.</p>

1746-1750", p. 45. Capt. Simeon Potter of Bristol (a town in
Massachusetts till January, 1747, in Rhode Island after that date) was
one of the most noted and successful of the privateers of his time.
His raid on French Guiana in November, 1744, though not enormously
profitable nor of much military importance, makes a very picturesque
story, chiefly because of the vivid account we have of it from one of
its victims, Father Elz&eacute;ar Fauque, an intelligent Jesuit, who was
serving the mission at Oyapoc, and was carried away as a prisoner by
Potter when he sacked and destroyed that settlement. Father Fauque's
narrative, a letter to an officer of his society, dated from Cayenne,
Dec. 22, 1744, is in the <span xml:lang="fr"><i>Lettres &Eacute;difiantes et Curieuses</i></span>, XXVII.
172-250 (Paris 1749), VIII. 387-454 (ed. 1781), IV. 493-533 (ed.
1819), II. 34-50 (ed. 1838). There is an English translation in Bishop
W.I. Kip's <i>Historical Scenes from the Old Jesuit Missions</i> (N.Y.,
1875), pp. 153-205, reprinted in Professor W.H. Munro's <i>Tales of an
Old Sea Port</i> (Princeton, 1917), pp. 48-93, in which Potter's life is
also told. The admiralty case arose from questions respecting disposal
of the booty. Prince Charles of Lorraine was brother-in-law of Maria
Theresa, and commanded her army against Frederick the Great. According
to Father Fauque, the privateer so named carried 10 cannon, 12
swivel-guns and 61 men. <span xml:lang="fr"><i>Lettres &Eacute;difiantes</i></span> (ed. 1819), IV. 494.</p></div>

an extract from a letter written by him to his owners, sent to that
journal from Newport: "We came to an Anchor at Y'opoch River, took a
Craft by which we had an Account of a considerable French Settlement
up that River, with a Fort of six Carriage Guns and 50 Soldiers,
excluding Officers: We went with the Prisoners we took into the Craft
(bound) before us as our Guides: At one o'clock in the Morning we
landed a small Distance from the Fort, gave three Huzza's and entred
the same Sword in Hand, took it without the loss of one Man, kept
Possession thereof 8 Days, took in Plunder 9 Indians, 2 Negroes, a
Mulatto Wench, 50 Small-Arms, 5 Casks of Powder, and a small Quantity
of Plate, and took 10 Prisoners. We then steered for Surinam and sent
up for Liberty to refit, but were refused by the Governor thereof: How
far this is consistent with the Treaties between England and Holland,
I for my part must leave to others to determine."</p></div>

and Damn'd them threatning them with his drawn sword at their Breasts,
which Treatment Obliged the Men to hold their Peace and when said

and a Paper containing an accot. of the Cargoe he then had on Board,
we Inquired for the rest of his Papers, he answered he had left them
in Martinico, we told him such mistakes were not at all likely, and
therefore must Send him into Port. he made Use of many horrid
Imprecations, and many times offered to Swear, his Vessell and Cargoe
was a Dutch Property and that neither french nor Spaniards were anyway
Concerned in either. when we Told him he must go in his Sloop for
Rhode Island, his answer Generally was, what Signifies my going with
the Sloop without my papers, do but first lett me go to Curacoa and
furnish myself w'th papers and then I will follow my Sloop. and his
Sloop being Leaky we Concluded to heave her down and stop her leaks

<p>The Petition of Edward Winter of Boston Blacksmith Humbly Sheweth,</p>

<p>That in the Year 1744 there were nine persons committed to the County
Goal<a name="FNanchor_3_1269" id="FNanchor_3_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1269" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in Boston, being charged with committing divers acts of
Piracy, Hostility etc. on the high Seas and soon after they were put
into Goal, they attempted to get off their Irons and make their Escape
but being discovered were prevented, and thereupon your Petr: was
ordered to Search and Examine their Irons several times in a week,
which he accordingly did from the 12th day of January 1744 to the 23d
of July 1746, 253 times, and charged the Province for the same the
small price of one shilling a time, amounting in the whole to &pound;12. 13.
0 bills of the last tenor,<a name="FNanchor_4_1270" id="FNanchor_4_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1270" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and put in his Bill to the Committee
appointed by the special Court of Admiralty who try'd said Prisoners,
to Examine the Acco'ts of Charges that had arisen on said Prisoners,
but the same was not allowed by them, they apprehending the Pet'rs
Bill sho'd be paid by the County (tho' all other charges upon 'em the
Province paid) and said Committee accordingly recommended it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span> the
Court of Sessions to pay the same, to whom your Petr. has since appl'd
but they absolutely refused paying it, so that your Petr. unless that
he is relieved by this Hon: Court is like to suffer greatly.</p>

<p>Your Petr. therefore prays your Excellency and Honours will be pleased
to take the premises into Consideration, and as all the other charges
were paid by the Province, he prays he mayn't be the only sufferer,

vice-admiralty judge, Lucas Santen, New York, 1683, has already been
inserted in this volume, as <a href="#DOC_51">doc. no. 51</a>, but that, besides being
issued under a proprietary, and so not wholly typical, was not a
commission to Santen <i>as</i> admiralty judge but a special commission for
the trial of piracy. Another typical specimen, to Richard Morris, New
York, Oct. 16, 1762, may be seen in E.C. Benedict, <i>The American
Admiralty</i>, third ed., pp. 79-84; fourth ed., pp. 76-80. Benedict
states that he has also seen the commissions of Roger Mompesson, Apr.
1, 1703, of Francis Harrison, Feb. 13, 1721, and of Lewis Morris, Jan.
16, 1738, who served as judge in New York till 1762. All three were

British Colonies</i> (London, 1783), pp. 284-288; already in print, but
inasmuch as the most learned of American admiralty judges told the
editor of this volume that he had never seen a set of the standing
interrogatories, that were used at this period, it seems not
superfluous to print one here. Later sets, more elaborate, as used in
1798, may be found in Christopher Robinson's <i>Admiralty Reports</i>, I.
381-389, and in Marriott, <span xml:lang="la"><i>Formulare Instrumentorum</i></span> (London, 1802),
pp. 130-148. Since in civil-law procedure witnesses were not examined
orally in open court, but all testimony was obtained in the form of
written depositions, it was advisable in prize proceedings, in order
that examinations might be thorough and searching, to employ standard
sets of questions, ready-made. Anthony Stokes (1735-1799), from whose
book the present specimen is taken, was an English or Welsh lawyer,
practised law in Antigua and St. Christopher 1763-1769, and was
chief-justice of Georgia, 1769-1776, 1779-1782, then retired to
England as a loyalist. His book contains many specimens of documents
used in proceedings before the vice-admiralty courts in the colonies.</p></div>

relating to the cases, preserved by an exceptionally careful assistant
register. By the care of Hon. Charles M. Hough, U.S. circuit judge,
these papers have been arranged, mounted, and bound in model fashion.
In interpreting the papers here printed, the editor has been much

</p><p>
The case of the <span xml:lang="es"><i>Virgen del Rosario</i></span>, more exactly the cases of
Richard Haddon <i>v.</i> 10 Doubloons, etc., of <span xml:lang="es">Yba&ntilde;ez</span> <i>v.</i> &pound;2409, and of
the King <i>v.</i> Thomas Miller and Sampson Simpson, give excellent
illustrations of the chicanery with which prize cases could be
conducted and of the manner in which through admiralty courts the ends
of justice could be defeated. The materials are copious. The history
of the capture is sufficiently set forth in docs. <a href="#DOC_187">no. 187</a> and <a href="#DOC_188">no. 188</a>.
The legal history of the case may be summarized as follows. Sept. 20,
1756, Nathaniel Marston and Jasper Farmar petition governor and
council for a privateer's commission for the <i>Peggy</i> or <i>Charming
Peggy</i>, whereof Richard Haddon was to be commander, Christopher Miller
lieutenant; <i>Cal. N.Y. Hist. MSS.</i>, II. 659. Sept. 29, 1756, the
commission is granted. Dec. 7, 1756, the <i>Peggy</i> captures the schooner
<span xml:lang="es"><i>La Virgen del Rosario y el Santo Christo de Buen Viage</i></span>, plunders
her, and lets her go. (It will be remembered that Great Britain was
not at war with Spain at this time, but only with France.) Mar. 5,
1757, the <i>Peggy</i> arrives at New York, "having taken as many Prizes
during her Cruize as she could well man"; <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, Mar.
10. Mar. 9, Haddon libels the plunder (<a href="#DOC_184">doc. no. 184</a>). Mar. 31, the
admiralty judge decrees that it shall be his, provided no better
claimant arises within a year and a day, and provided he furnishes
sureties to the register of the court to the value of &pound;2409. 4s. 11d.;
notes of Sir William Burrell on this case in <i>Reports of Cases
determined by the High Court of Admiralty and upon Appeal therefrom,
temp. Sir Thomas Saulsbury and Sir George Hay</i>, ed. R.G. Marsden
(London, 1885), pp. 185-186. July 26, 1757, the sureties present their
account of sales (<a href="#DOC_186">doc. no. 186</a>). Feb. 17, 1758, and Mar. 10, on
pressure from London, where Captain <span xml:lang="es">Yba&ntilde;ez</span> has made his complaint, the
advocate general in New York files a claim for money and goods, in the
king's name, to restore them to the Spaniards. Apr. 5, the sureties
demur. Apr. 19, the judge dismisses the advocate general's claim.
Sept. 27, 1758, <span xml:lang="es">Yba&ntilde;ez</span> files his own claim or libel (<a href="#DOC_188">doc. no. 188</a>),
but the judge rules Feb. 10, 1759, that his time had expired (Marsden,
<i>loc. cit.</i>). Dec. 19, 1760, the Lords Commissioners of Appeals in
Prize Causes reverse the colonial court, and condemn the captor in
costs and damages (<i>ibid.</i>, and <a href="#DOC_195">doc. no. 195</a>). July 4 and 26, 1761,
the New York judge declares that, while the Lords of Appeal had
apparently reversed his decree of Mar. 31, 1757, on Haddon's libel,
they had not reversed his decree of Feb. 10, 1759, on that of <span xml:lang="es">Yba&ntilde;ez</span>,
the decree actually appealed from (court papers). But so the matter
had been dragged on until, Jan. 4, 1762, Great Britain declared war
against Spain, and it may be considered certain that <span xml:lang="es">Yba&ntilde;ez</span> never
recovered anything; perhaps he did not deserve to, for pretty clearly
he had been violating or evading the laws of his own country.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, July 14, 1758, the advocate general, on account of
irregularities on Haddon's part violating his commission as a
privateer, had sued his bondsmen (King <i>v.</i> Miller and Simpson). Their
counsel moved for a commission to take evidence in Havana, which was
granted by the court, Sept. 2, 1758; hence docs. nos. <a href="#DOC_189">189</a>, <a href="#DOC_191">191-194</a>.
June 27, 1761, on all the evidence now collected, the court decreed
forfeiture of the bond. July 7, 1761, the sureties appealed (<a href="#DOC_196">doc. no.
196</a>), but there is no record evidence that their appeal was ever
perfected, or that they ever paid. See <a href="#DOC_196">doc. 196</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_1352">note 1</a>.</p></div>

<p>The Deposition of Francisco Raphe Having been before Sworn and now

private Vessel of War the <i>Peggy</i>, Against Ten Doubleloons, five
Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty four Dollars, One Hundred and five
Pisterreens, one Bracelet, Twenty Gold Rings, Some Silver Buckles,
Some Small Silver, Six Swivel Guns, Some Shot, one Cask of Powder,
Some Cuttlasses and one Keg of Indigo.</p>

<p>1. To the first Interrogatory this Deponent saith that his Name is
Francis Rafe, and is twenty Six Years of Age,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span> that he is a Native of
Sierra<a name="FNanchor_2_1298" id="FNanchor_2_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1298" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in Greece and Subject to the Grand Turk, by Ocupation a
Mariner.</p>

<p>2. To the second He says, that two Days after the Vessel he was on
board of Sailed out of Cuba they were taken by Capn. Haddon, which was
about December last, that he does not know the Vessels Name of which
he was aboard for she had no Regular Commander, no Dispatches or
Papers of any kind from any Port or Place whatsoever And he believes
that had said Vessel been taken by any Vessel of any Nation she would
have been a lawfull prize, and had she been taken by a Spanish Guarda
Costa, the whole Ships Crew would have been Hanged as Pirates, that
there were on board of all Nations almost, as Genoves, French and
others, In Number Seventy two, and that one of the Chief in Particular
was a Frenchman Subject to the French King. That He knows no further
to Declare in Relation to any other Interrogatories, but only that He
absolutly from all the Knowledge he can form thinks her to be a just
and Lawfull prize.</p>

going in said Schooner was to trade at Jamaica. That said Schooner had
no more Mariners on board than is Customary nor so many as is quite
Necessary for such a Vessel. That there was no such person on board
said Schooner as Francisco Raphel<a name="FNanchor_11_1314" id="FNanchor_11_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1314" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> at the time she was taken by
Richd. Haddon nor any French Subjects.</p>

<p>3ly. That all the Papers was the Licence and some Letters for some
Merch'ts at Kingston in Jamaica. That said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span> Licence was for said

<p>5ly. That said Richd. Haddon when he met with the said Spanish
Schooner fired a Ball at her notwithstanding she had her Spanish
Colours Flying and had brought to to speak with said Haddon and the
Reason that induced said Deponent not to make the most of his way from
said Privateer was that he knew the two Crowns of England and Spain to
be in Friendship. That the Privateer Boat came on board said Spanish
Schooner with a Lieut. Christop'r Miller<a name="FNanchor_15_1318" id="FNanchor_15_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_1318" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> by Name and seven more

discovered the Money which as soon as they had done, they Insisted on
the Spaniards having run away with it and gave that as a pretence for
Seising it which they did and carryed the same away by Force with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
other particulars already mentioned by this Deponent. That said Richd.

three) on board the Privateer and there treated them as Prisoners,
said Haddon being on board. That he this Deponent told said Haddon
from whence he came and where he was bound to and that he was a
Subject of Spain and declared that Himself was Commander of said
Schooner when she Sailed from the Havana and that he shewed said
Haddon his Licence and other Papers. That said Haddon did not declare
that he would carry the said Schooner to the Havana, on the contrary
this Deponent and the People belonging to the Spanish Schooner were
very desirous of it and requested of him to carry them there. That
said Rd. Haddon's Lieut. and People did by Force and Violence Seize
said Money and Effects and carry them away against the Consent and
Solisitation of this Deponent and people belonging to said Spanish
Schooner. That said Span'h Schooner was at that time in good Order and
well Conditioned both as to her Hull, Sails and Rigging and fitt to
come to New York. That this Depont. desired of sd. Rd. Haddon that the
Money might be Counted but sd. Haddon Refused it. That when this
Deponent and People were brought on board the Privateer they were all
of them Searched and Money and Effects taken from the Several

pair Gold Buttons, From Don Geronimo de la Cal 1 pair of silver
Buckles and a Ring, From Pablo Antonio Corea 1 pr Silver Buckles, From

taken from the People beside the Money and Effects brought from on
board the Spanish Schooner. That said Rd. Haddon never told them that
he would proceed to New York in order to Lybel the Money and Effects
aforesaid but on the Contrary Endeavoured to Conceal his Name and from
whence he came as much as possible from this Deponent and his people.
That there never was any Agreement between this Deponent and his
People with Rd Haddon or anything like it relating to the Money and
Effects aforesaid. That said Richd. Haddon's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span> Lieut. Chrsr. Miller by
Name, with some of the Mariners belonging to said Privateer, did treat
this Deponent and Comp'y belonging to said Spanish Schooner with
threatning and abusive Language on Returning them on board said
Spanish Vessel. That said Rd. Haddon did not offer to bring this
Depont. and People to New York, for as was declared before He did not
mention New York nor did this Deponent and People know he came from
thence. That said Rd. Haddon did take from on board said Spanish
Schooner and carry away with him in the said private Vessel of War,
two Passengers by Names Henry Myerhoffer and Willm. Abbot both
subjects of Great Britn. That this Deponent did Request said Richd.
Haddon to carry him to some Eng'h Port but was refused. That he this
Deponent did Request from said Richd. Haddon a Receipt or Certificate
Acknowledging that he the sd Rd. Haddon had taken from on board the
said Span'h Schooner the Money and Effects aforesaid, which said
Deponent Requested in order to shew as a proof of what had happened to
him. That the said Richd. Haddon did thereupon give this Deponent a
Receipt or Certificate, but afterwards said Receipt was Demanded from
him by the said Christopher Miller which this Deponent Refusing to
Return, said Chrisr. Miller did by Threats, Force and Violence take
said Receipt or Certificate from this said Deponent as they were in a
Boat in their Return on board said Spanish Schooner.</p>

Lucea<a name="FNanchor_16_1319" id="FNanchor_16_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_1319" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> on the Island of Jamaica, whereupon this Deponent determined
to go there in Quest of him in order to procure Satisfaction for the
Injury he had Received from him. That shortly after the Arrival of
this Deponent at the Havana, an English Man of War came into that
Port. That He this Deponent made Application to the Capn. for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span> his

Voyage from Trinidada, and having a Passport for Mansennello he went
to the Havannah leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span> his said Schooner at a Landing Place about
eight Leagues distant from thence called Vanes<a name="FNanchor_1_1323" id="FNanchor_1_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1323" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and there in
Pursuance of a Proposal which had been for that Purpose made to him
before he had left Trinidada aforesaid on the 10th of November one
Thousand seven hundred and fifty six entered into a written Agreement
with Caleb Davis<a name="FNanchor_2_1324" id="FNanchor_2_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1324" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the English Nation and Transiently in that
City, the Purport of which Agreement was that he should carry in his
said Schooner one Henry Myerhoeffer and one Wm. Abbot an Englishman to
Port Royal on the Island of Jamaica carrying with them certain Papers

charged in Virtue of an Order from his Sovereign the King of Great
Britain, who were to remit to him the said Caleb certain Merchandize
which he had given them Orders to send on his Account and Risque for
the Supply of his urgent Necessities which when complyed with he
obliged himself to pay to the said Philip the sum of one thousand
Dollars without Delay, as by the said Agreement ready to be produced
may appear; That after his having made the said Agreement, his said
schooner being at the said Landing Place called Vane's he took on
Board the said Schooner the said Henry Myerhoffer and Wm. Abbot and
their Letters and Papers and Eight other Persons, all subjects of his

thirty swivel shot of the Value of fifteen shillings, all New York
money, together with sundry other Goods mentioned in a Lybel filed in
this Court by the said Richard Haddon hereinafter mentioned, all which
were the Property of him the said Philip Y'Banes and others the
Subjects of the King of Spain in Amity and Friendship with the King of
Great Britain; That he the said Philipe afterwards being in the Course
of his Voyage to the Island of Jamaica aforesaid on the high Seas and
within the jurisdiction of this Court about ten Leagues to the
Southward of the Island of Pines, on or about the sixth day of
December which was in the year of our Lord one Thousand seven hundred
and fifty six, he the said Philip was attacked and set upon in his
said Schooner by one Richard Haddon, Commander of a Schooner called
the <i>Peggy</i> being a private Vessel of War from this Port of New York;
That he the said Richard Haddon having fired a Gun against the said
Spanish Schooner and brought her to, sent the Boat of the said
Privateer on Board the said Spanish Schooner, manned and armed,
together with one officer of him the said Richard Haddon which the
said Philip took to be his first Lieutenant, and others of the Crew of
the said Privateer <i>Peggy</i>, who searched into and Examined the sd
Spanish Vessel where they found all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span> money and Goods aforesaid,
all which by the said Officer and Crew were taken out of the said
Spanish Schooner and carried on Board the said Privateer the <i>Peggy</i>,
commanded by the said Richard Haddon; That he the said Philip Y Banes
was then and there in a forcible manner taken out of the said Spanish
Schooner by the said Lieutenant and Crew of the said Privateer the
<i>Peggy</i> or some of them and carried on Board the said Privateer, where
the said Philip Y: Banes was searched from Head to Foot by the said
Richard Haddon, the said Lieutenant or officer and others of the Crew
belonging to the said Privateer by the Orders of the said Richard
Haddon, and he the said Philip was then and there unlawfully stripped
by the said Richard Haddon and others of his Crew of the Value of Two
Hundred and twelve Dollars in Gold which he the sd. Philip had
concealed in his Breeches; That he the said Philip did then and there
shew to him the said Richard Haddon his Passport and other papers and
Documents evincing Spanish Property in his said Schooner and Cargo,
and the Intent of his present voyage, and did insist and declare to
him the said Richard Haddon that his sd. Vessel and all the Money,
Goods and Effects that he had on Board wch. had been so seized and
taken as aforesaid were the Property of himself and others the
subjects of his said Catholick Majesty and did belong to no other
Person or Persons whosoever, and did request and intreat him the said
Richard Haddon to restore to him the said Philip the said Money, Goods
and Effects, or to bring him into this port of New York that he might
have an Oppertunity of making his Claim and proving his property to
and in the monies Goods and Effects so taken from him the said Philip
by him the said Richard, his Officers and Crew as aforesaid, But the
said Richard Haddon did altogether refuse to restore the same to the
said Philip or to permit or Suffer him the said Philipe or any of his
Officers or People to come with him in the said Schooner <i>Peggy</i> to
this Port of New York; That the said Philip did then desire the said
Richard to give him a Receipt or Certificate of the money, Goods and
Effects which had been so seized and taken from him as aforesaid, that
he might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span> satisfy all parties concerned in the same Money, Goods and
Effects of the manner How he had been deprived of the same; That the
said Richard did then Deliver to the said Philip a Writing which he
said did Contain such Receipt or Certificate, But afterwards the first
Lieutenant of him the said Richard did require and Insist that he the
said Philipe should redeliver the same to him; That the said Philip
refused to redeliver the said writing and thereupon the said first
Lieutenant lifting up his Fist threatned to knock him down if he
resisted, and with his Other Hand took the said Certificate thus
forcibly and Violently out of said Philips Pocket where he had
endeavored to secure the same, And the said Philip further sheweth
that the said Richard did also take from on board the said Schooner
the said Henry Myerhoffer and William Abbot, his said two Passengers,
And also his passport and other papers shewn to him the said Richard
to the purpose aforesaid, and after giving the said Philip very
threating and abusive Language did then and there send the said
Philip, despoiled and deprived of his money, Goods and Effects,
passport and other papers aforesaid, on Board his said Spanish
Schooner; That the said Richard Haddon did afterwards proceed with the
said privateer <i>Peggy</i> to Lucea on the Island of Jamaica and there
careened and fitted her for the sea and during the time he say<a name="FNanchor_5_1327" id="FNanchor_5_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1327" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
there kept the said Henry Myerhoffer and William Abbot closely
confin'd in order to prevent their discovering or Complaining of this
Treatment he the said Philip had received from the said Richard
Haddon, his Officers and Crew as aforesaid. And when and not before
the said privateer had Hoisted sail to Leave Lucea aforesaid the said
Henry Myerhoffer and William Abbot were set at Liberty, and the said
Privateer proceeded to sea. And the said Philip further Sheweth that
He the said Richard Haddon in the said Privateer Did afterwards Arrive
at this port of New York And that the said Richard Haddon did
afterwards on or about the ninth Day of March in the Year of our Lord
one Thousand Seven hun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>dred and fifty six<a name="FNanchor_6_1328" id="FNanchor_6_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1328" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> by his Lybel filed in
this Court claim Part of the Money, Goods, and Effects which had been
taken from him the said Philip in Manner aforesaid, viz. Ten
Doubloons, five Thousand seven hundred and sixty four Dollars, one
Hundred and five Pistreens and some small Silver, as also one
Bracelet, twenty gold Rings, some Silver Buckles, six swivel Guns,
some Shot, one Cask of Powder, some Cutlasses and one Bag of Indigo,
as being the Property of the Subjects of the French King and prayed
that the same might by the Sentence of this Court be adjudged and
condemned as Lawfull Prize to him the said Richard Haddon and the
Owners and Company of the said Privateer <i>Peggy</i>, as by the said Lybel
filed in this Court, Reference being hereunto had, may more fully
appear; That the said Philip not having any Pilot or Person on Board
his said Vessel who was acquainted with the Navigation on this Coast
was all together deprived of the Means and Opportunity of making his
Claim and Defence to the said Lybel; That immediately after the said
Seizure he returned with said Spanish Schooner to the Havannah, and
complained there, of the said abuse that he had received from the sd.
Richard Haddon and his Officers and Company. That the Governour of the
Havannah<a name="FNanchor_7_1329" id="FNanchor_7_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1329" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> hearing thereof highly resented the same (and as the said
Philip has been informed and hopes to prove) wrote to his Excellency
Sr. Charles Hardy, then Governour of this Province,<a name="FNanchor_8_1330" id="FNanchor_8_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1330" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> upon the Matter
of his said Complaint, demanding Redress, And that at that Time there
being a British Man of War lying in that Port the Said Philip also
made the like Complaint to the Commander of the said Ship who advised
the said Philip immediately to repair with his Schooner to Jamaica and
make his Case known to the Government there and Particularly to
Admiral Townshend who was upon that Station, That upon proper
Representations being made, Justice might be obtained and Reparation
procured to the said Philip by Means and assistance of the British
Government;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span> That accordingly the said Philip proceeded to Jamaica and
arrived there on or about the Beginning of March one Thousand seven
hundred and fifty seven and applied to Admiral Townsend and made his
Affidavit of the Treatment and Usage that he had received from the
said Richard Haddon and the said Officers and Crew of the said
Privateer <i>Peggy</i> before a proper Officer there, and also finding the
said Henry Myerhoffer in that Island he procured his Affidavit to be
taken of the like matter, both which affidavits properly certified
under the Seal of the said Island are filed with the Register of this
Court and to which the said Philip for greater Certainty doth refer;
That his Majesty the King of Great Britain, being informed of the
Premises by Affidavits concerning the same, transmitted by Admiral
Townsend, did by a Letter from the Right Honourable the Earl of
Holdernesse his Secretary of State to the Governour of this Province,
Dated at Whitehall the twentieth Day of May one Thousand seven hundred
and fifty seven,<a name="FNanchor_9_1331" id="FNanchor_9_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1331" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> express the deepest resentment of the said Injury
done to the said Philip by the said Richard Haddon and the officers
and Crew belonging to the said private Vessel of War, as being
contrary to all Humanity and Good Faith and the General Instructions
Given to Privateers, And did require and demand that Justice might be
done within this his Government to the Subjects of his Catholick
Majesty relating to the Premises, as by the said Letter filed in the
Minutes of his Majesty's Council for this Province of New York<a name="FNanchor_10_1332" id="FNanchor_10_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1332" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and
an attested Copy thereof filed with the Register of this Court, to
which the said Philip doth refer, may more fully and at large appear.
And the said Philip further sheweth That during these Transactions in
the West Indies and in Great Britain he the said Richard Haddon
prosecuted his said Lybel in this Court and to give the better Colour
to his Pretensions that the Money, Goods and Effects before mentioned
were French Property did on the thirty first of March one Thousand
seven hundred and fifty seven procure Some Person calling himself
Francisco Raphe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span> to be examined before the Register of this Court<a name="FNanchor_11_1333" id="FNanchor_11_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1333" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
on the Part of him the said Richard Haddon against the Money, Goods
and Effects mentioned in his said Lybel, wherein the said Francisco
Raphe deposes among other Things that he is a Native of Sierra in
Greece and Subject of the Grand Turk, by Occupation a Marriner, That
two Days after the Vessel, he was on Board of, sailed out of Cuba they
were taken by Captain Haddon which was about December then last, That
he did not know the Vessel's Name of which he was on Board for She had
no regular Commander nor Dispatches or Papers of any Kind from any
Port or Place whatsoever, and he believes that had such Vessel been
taken by any vessel of any Nation She would have been a lawfull Prize
And had She been taken by a Spanish Guarda Costa, the whole Ship's
Crew would have been hanged as Pirates, That there were on Board, of
all Nations allmost, as Genoesse, French and others, in Number twenty
two, and that one of the Chiefs in particular was a French man,
Subject of the French King, That he absolutely, from all the Knowledge
he can form, thinks her to be a just and lawfull Prize; And he the
said Philip further sheweth that he is advised that the said
Deposition is of a very extraordinary Nature, and made by one who
supposed himself to have been a Pyrate; That by Reason of its great
Incertainty it can have no legal Application either to him the said
Philip or his Schooner; that the Vessel on which the said Francisco
Raphe was on Board was a Ship of the Crew Whereof he was one; That the
said Schooner of the said Philip had a regular Commander and proper
Dispatches and Papers from Trindada a Spanish Port; That not one
French Man or Geno&eacute; was on Board the said Schooner nor any one
Marriner or passenger Except the said Henry Myerhoffer and William
Abbot that was not a Subject of Spain; And the said Philip further
sheweth That he is an entire Stranger to the said Francisco Raphe,
That he knows no Person of that Name, and is very certain that no such
person was either a Seamen or Passenger on Board the said Schooner in
the Voyage before mentioned, and the said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span> Philip is informed that no
Witness whatsoever was produced in this Court to Prove the Money,
Goods and Effects mentioned in the said Lybel of the said Richd.
Haddon to be French Property but the said Francisco Raphe, and that by
the Minutes of this Court it will appear that on the very Day the said
Examination was taken Publication was ordered to pass and the Cause to
be immediately heard, and thereupon the Proctor for the said Richard
Haddon opened the Lybel and Proceedings, and the Deposition of the
said Francisco Raphe being read this Court having considered of the
same did adjudge, Sentence and decree the said Money, Goods and
Effects in the said Lybel mentioned as lawfull Prize for the use of
the Captors, pursuant to the Statute in that Case made and <i>provided</i>
that no just and rightful Claim be made for the same by any Other
Person or Persons within a year and a Day, and ordered that the
Lybellant stipulate with Security to the Register of this Court in the
Amount of the said Gold, Silver and other Things to bring the said
Amount into this Court when this Court should order the same within a
year and a Day aforesaid, To which Minute of this Court the said
Philip doth refer, And the sd. Philip further sheweth That at a Court
of Vice Admiralty held at the City of New York on the twenty-sixth Day
of July then next following, pursuant to the order of this Court of
the thirty first Day of March then last past, the Accounts of Sales of
the said Gold, Silver and other Things lybelled as aforesaid were
brought into this Court and filed,<a name="FNanchor_12_1334" id="FNanchor_12_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1334" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> And that thereupon Jasper
Farmer and Thomas Miller of the City of New York, Merchants, appeared
in this Court and freely and voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction
thereof And severally stipulated to the Register of this Court in the
Sum of Two Thousand four Hundred and nine Pounds, four Shillings and
eleven Pence three Farthings, said to be the Amount of the said Gold,
Silver etc. on Condition to bring the said Money into this Court when
this Court should order the same at any Time within a year and a Day
from the said thirty first Day of March then last past, as by the said
Orders and Proceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>ings of this Court to which the said Philip doth
refer, Relation being thereunto had, may appear. And the said Philip
further sheweth that by the said Letter of the Right Honourable the
Earl of Holdernesse before mentioned and above referred to, his
Majesty The King of Great Britain did Command Prosecutions to be
immediately commenced for the Recovery of what should appear to be so
plundered from the said Philip and others the Subjects of the King of
Spain or the full Value thereof, with all Costs and Damages occasioned
by the premises; That his said Majesty's Advocate General for this
Province of New York, in obedience to his Majesty's Pleasure so
signified and the express Order and Direction of his Honour the
Lieutenant Governour of this Province and Commander in Chief then
being (having received Information of the said Orders and Proceedings
of this Court) to prevent any Prejudice to the Subjects of the said
King of Spain, in consequence of the same did on the seventeenth Day
of February last past, in the Name and Behalf of his said Majesty the
King of Great Britain, for the Use and Benefit of the said Philip and
other Subjects of the King of Spain, enter and file his Claim to the
Money and Goods first above mentioned, which had been with Force and
Violence taken from him the sd. Philip, declaring it to be intended
therein to include all the Particulars that had been before libelled
by the said Richard Haddon and other Goods that had not been so
lybelled, but had been taken and seized by the said Richard Haddon in
Manner as aforesaid, together with the Interest, Damages and Costs
which had accrued by Reason of the Premises; That afterwards the said
Advocate General on the tenth of March last in Obedience to the Orders
aforesaid did file his Claim more at large In this Court and among
other Things therein contained prayed that this Court would order and
decree that the said Monies, Goods and Chattels in the said Lybel of
the said Richard Haddon mentioned might by the Order of this Court be
brought into this Court according to the Stipulation aforesaid, as by
the said Claim filed with the Register of this Court, to which the
said Philip doth refer, may more fully and at large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span> appear.
Whereupon, on the said tenth Day of March, it was ordered by this
Court that the Securities of the said Richard Haddon do bring into
this Court the said Sum of two Thousand four Hundred and nine Pounds,
four Shillings and Eleven Pence three Farthings, being the Amount of
their Stipulations aforesaid, on or before that day Week or Shew Cause
to the contrary; That on the seventeenth Day of March last the said
Jasper Farmer and Thomas Miller appeared in this Court by their
Proctor But did not bring into this Court the said Sum last mentioned
and had Time till the fifth Day of April following to shew Cause why
they had not done it, on which Day they filed their Demurrer to the
said Claim of the said Advocate General, alledging for Cause of
Demurrer that it appeared by the said Claim that the Scope and End
thereof was to relieve the said Philip y: Banes, a Spaniard, claiming
the Money and Effects formerly Lybelled in this Court by Richard
Haddon in Behalf of himself and the Owners and Company of the Schooner
<i>Peggy</i>, as French Property, against the Sentence and Decree of this
Court, to all which several Matters and other Things in the said Claim
contained the said Defendants did demur.</p>

<p>For That, by the Claim it appears that his said Majesty the King of
Great Britain ought not to recover the Money, Goods and Effects in the
Claim mentioned, they being expressly therein declared to be the
Property of a Spanish Subject, and not the Property of his said
Majesty the King of Great Britain, And for that his said Majesty ought
not by Law to sue for himself and a Subject in that Suit, And for
[that] a Decree in that Suit would be no Barr to a new Suit brought in
the Name of his Majesty on the Stipulation for the good Behaviour of
the said Richard Haddon, And for that by Law no Subject is to answer
to the King, for an Injury done to another Subject, but by a Criminal
Prosecution, And for that a Decree upon that Claim would be no Barr
to, nor could it prevent the said Philip Y: Banes from filing his
Claim in his own Name, And for that divers Persons are made Parties to
that Claim that ought not to be joined together, as by the said
Demurrer filed with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span> Register of this Court to which the said
Philip doth refer may more at large appear. And the said Philip
further sheweth that he hath not hitherto obtained any recompense or
satisfaction for the Injury aforesaid.</p>

<p>Wherefore he the said Philip for the Reasons aforesaid and for the
several Matters and Causes offered and insisted on in this his Libel
doth Humbly Claim the said Two Thousand four Hundred and nine Pounds,
four Shillings and Eleven Pence three Farthings, secured to be paid
into this Court by the Stipulation aforesaid, together also with all
and every the other Monies, Goods and Effects so seized and taken from
him by the said Richard Haddon as aforesaid and not mentioned in the
Lybel of him the said Richard, and all Damages, Losses and Expenses by
him the said Philip in any wise sustained by Reason of the Premises
And Humbly prays the Advisement of this Court in the Premises and the
due Process of the Law against the said Two Thousand four Hundred and
nine Pounds, four Shillings and eleven Pence three Farthings, secured
to be paid into this Court by the Stipulation aforesaid, and all and
every other such due Process as by the Law ought to issue and be
granted against all and every Person and Persons who is, are or may be
liable and Chargeable for the same and for all and every other the
Monies, Goods and Effects so seized and taken from Him the said Philip
as aforesaid and for his Losses and Damages and Expenses aforesaid,
and such full and ample Relief and Satisfaction touching the Premises
as, by the Law of Nations, the particular Laws and Statutes of Great
Britain, and the Custom and Usage of this Court, is due in cases of
this Nature to the Subjects of his Catholick Majesty the King of Spain
being in Amity with his Majesty the King of Great Britain.</p>

<p>
Province of New York.<br />
Court of Vice Admiralty.<br />
</p>

<p>The Deposition of William Haddon who having been before Sworn and now
examined on the Interrogatories to be administered to witnesses to be
produced, Sworn and Examd. on the part and behalf of Thomas Miller and
Sampson Simpson, defendants, at the suit of the attorney General In
the name of our Lord the King Libbellant.</p>

<p>1st. To the First of the said Interrogatories this deponent saith that
his name is William Haddon, aged thirty eight years, his usually place
of residence is at New York, By occupation a schoolmaster<a name="FNanchor_1_1341" id="FNanchor_1_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1341" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and a
subject to the King of England.</p>

<p>2d. To the second Interrogatory this deponent saith that he knows
Richard Haddon, late commander of the private Sloop of war called the
<i>peggy</i>, that the said Richard Haddon is this deponents brother and he
has Known him as long as he has had knowledge.</p>

<p>3d. To the third Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he knew a
person called Don Philip, which this deponent supposes to be the same
person Philip Vanes, otherwise called Philip De Francois, otherwise
called Philip Y Banes, mentioned in the third Interrogatory, that he
first saw him the 7th of December 1756, In the Latitude of 21 and 33
m. N.<a name="FNanchor_2_1342" id="FNanchor_2_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1342" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Longitude 81&deg; and 30 m.</p>

<p>4th. To the fourth Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he saw a
certain Schooner pretended to be a spanish Schooner, But did not know
her name, and first became acquainted with her the 7th of December
1756, In the Latitude of 21 and 23 N: and Longitude 81 and 30, this
de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>ponent was on board the privateer <i>peggy</i> when the said Schooner
was taken, that he was Capn. Clerk,<a name="FNanchor_3_1343" id="FNanchor_3_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1343" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> this deponent is not very
positive but believes there was about fourteen men on board the said
schooner at the time she was taken, that the said schooner had four
carriage [and] six swivel Guns at the time she was brought too, as
this deponent afterwards heard, and that she had no regular papers or
Clearances from any publick authority, as this deponent saw or heard
at that time or since. This depont. also knows and remembers that
particular pains was taken by Capn. Haddon and all the officers
belonging to the said privateer to discover whether there were any
regular ships papers or Clearances on board the said schooner at the
time of her being taken, and in particular the Capn. when he sent
Christopher Miller on board, his first Lieutt., desired him to send
all the papers of the schooner on board the privt.; that after the sd.
first Liet. got on board he made a search and told the said Capn.
Haddon from the said schooner that he could find no regular papers on
board her, whereupon the Capn. told him bring all the papers he could
find and the Capn. of the sd. Schooner, upon which the Liet. made
answer he could not tell which was the Capn.; upon that the Capn. told
him to bring two or three of the Likeliest of the men, that he did so
and these men belonging to the said schooner came on board, one of
which, which the deponent took to be Don Philip, being asked for the
papers delivered a pocket book to the Capn. which the Capn opened upon
the Quarter deck and took out the papers; that this deponent was there
and saw nothing but a few Letters, sealed up and directed to Different
persons in Kingston; then sd. Capn. Haddon told the said Philip that
he certainly must have more papers; upon that sd Philip shrugged up
his shoulders and was Silent, and after that Capn Haddon called to the
first Liet., wo [who] was still on board the said Schooner, to make a
further Search, and this deponent never heard of any papers at all
being found that were satisfactory. the said Philip appd.<a name="FNanchor_4_1344" id="FNanchor_4_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1344" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to be the
Capn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span> or principal officer of the said schooner. this deponent
further Says that he heard Capn. Haddon say, upon the peoples asking
what he Intended to do with them, that he would carry them to the
Havannah, upon which as this deponent understood by the Interpretation
of one Francis De Spania, a Spaniard belonging to the privateer
<i>peggy</i>, and from the Declarations of Capn Haddon, they begged and
Intreated he would not, for that if he did they would either be hanged
or made slaves, and that they said they did not value the money, and
their lives would be of Little Service to Capn. Haddon, and the said
Capn. told this deponent the reason he did not send her into any port
for condemnation was partly out of humanity to the people and partly
in regard to the Interest of his owners. This deponent does not know
certainly but has been Informed that the said Schooner was not
properly equipped or fitt to come upon this Coast in the months of
December or January.</p>

<p>5th. To the fifth Interrogatory this deponent saith that to the best
of his Knowledge the said Schooner had on board of her at the time she
was brought to by the said privateer <i>peggy</i> about fourteen men,
composed of a Mixture of Nations, that the following Quantitys of
Money was taken out of the said and brought on board of the <i>peggy</i>
and Sorted on the deck and there counted, viz. 5764 Dollar, 10
Doubbloons, 105 pistereen, 1 Two Shilling, 1 shilling, five bitts, two
pair of Silver Knee buckles and one Box containing Sundry Trinkets of
Gold, to witt, one Bracelet, twenty Gold rings and one pair of Gold
Sleeve buttons; it was brought on board in a publick manner and it was
sorted and counted in this deponents presence and this deponent
understood that the said money and other things were owned among the
different persons on board.</p>

<p>6th. To the Sixth Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he heard that
the persons on board the said Schooner delivered up or gave the said
box or Trinkets to Capn Haddon on condition that he would not Carry
the said Schooner with the Crew thereof to the Havannah and further
saith not to this Interrogatory.</p>

<p>7th. To the Seventh Interrogatory this deponent saith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span> that he knows
that Capn. Haddon acquainted the persons on board the said Schooner
with the name of his vessel, his own name, the port she belonged to,
and that he should carry the things he had from on board the said
schooner to the port of New York for condemnation.</p>

<p>8th. To the eighth Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he remembers
That another Schooner was brought to by the <i>peggy</i> some short time
before the schooner was brought to out of which Capn. Haddon had the
money belonging to the Spanish Nation, and richly Laden and they were
Treated extreamly Civil by Capn. Haddon; this depont. Could not
observe from any of his conduct that he was desirous to rob or pilfer
them, but on their producing regular paper and clearances discharged
them, and this deponent knows of his supplying a Spanish Sloop with
provisions on the Twelfth of Jan'y 1757.</p>

<p>9th. To the Ninth Interrogatory this depont. saith that he knows of
nothing further that will tend to the advantage of the defendt. in
this Cause except That Capn. Haddon found a french Letter on board of
a prize which he took coming from the Mississippi, from a french
officer in Luisiania to a person of distinction in old france, by
which he understood that the french were Incroaching upon the Spanish
Territories and had still designs so to do, upon which Capn. Haddon
Inclosed the said french Letter in a Letter Directed to the Governour
of the Havannah, which said Letter this depont. wrote by direction of
the Capn.,<a name="FNanchor_5_1345" id="FNanchor_5_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1345" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and that the said Capn. always Treated prisoners and
others with humanity and Civilly and always acted with much care.</p>

<p>10th. To the Tenth Interrogatory this deponent Saith that he shall not
gain or loose by the event of the suit any other wise than by reason
of the near relationship he stands in to Capn. Haddon and by his
belonging to the said Vessel in the said Cruize.</p>

he had a Schooner of his Own and that making a Voyage in her he was
Robbed by some Englishmen, but did not say where he was bound to nor

with two or three English, but did not know their Names and
Consequently is Ignorant if they are the same that are mentioned in
the Enquiry and the other particulars thereof.</p>

<p>6. To the sixth he said that he only knew Antonio Correa by sight, by
being in Don Phelipe Ybanes's Company, that he has Understood he was a

Gov'r and Auditor of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span> City and Jurisdiction, Commissioned by his
Majesty in this Cause, Appeared Elizabeth Berrow, a Widow and
Inhabit't of this said City, and Swaring by the Sign of the Cross
according to Right and Form, promised to declare the Truth, and being
Enquired relating to the Tenor of the Articles Inserted in the
Interrogatory and Comprehended in the foregoing Copy Declared as
follows&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To the first she said that she knew Don Phelipe Ybanes in the year
56 by reason of his having been several times at her House, where
Caleb David an English Man Lodged, who he went to see; That she knew
said Ybanes to be a Spaniard by having heard it so Reported and that
he Married in this City; that he went to Sea in a Shooner of which he
was entire Owner, as said Caleb David and Ybanes himself Reported.</p>

<p>2. To the second she said that she understood from said Ybanes that
the Schooner which he called his own was Named <i>Our Lady of the
Rosary</i> though she never saw said Schooner in this Port. That the said
Ybanes before he went out in her came to see Caleb David and told him
in the presence of this Deponent that he had been thinking to make a
Voyage to Jamaica and that if he had any Commands there he would
Execute them, telling him that he carried to the Amount of Eight
Thousand Dollars in Money and Gold and Silver Trinkets. Upon which
said Caleb David gave him Several Letters of Recommendation for
Jamaica and desired him to carry two Englishmen that came with him in
the Long Boat from Campeche to this Port where the Embarkation in
which they arrived had been Confiscated.</p>

<p>3. To the third she said that she Refers to what she Answered in the
foregoing and that it does not appear to her that said Schooner
carried any other Cargoe beside the Money and Trinkets as aforesaid,
nor does she know if she went to Sea with Correspondent papers and
Passports or not, But when Don Phelipe Ybanes Returned to this City
and Related to Caleb David how the English Privateers had taken away
what he Carried and that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span> was minded to go to Jamaica and Reclaim
his Effects, said Caleb David offered him New Letters of
Recommendation and a Certificate that said Ybanes was not risen up as
the English had been pleased to Suppose but was only a Merchant.</p>

<p>4. To the fourth she said that she knew Caleb David very well, that he
Lodged three Months and odd Days at her House, by means of which she
came to know that his coming to this City was to Reclaim some prises
taken from the English Nation after the Cessation of Hostilities, to
which End he brought Powers from the Concerned and Dispatches from the
Court of Gt. Britain which he shewed to this Deponent.</p>

<p>5. To the fifth she said that she knew the two individuals mentioned,
the one of which was a German and the other an Englishman, but both
Subjects of the King of G'Brit'n and living in Georgia, who came to
this City with Caleb David in the aforesaid Long Boat and are the same
Persons that he desired Don Phelipe Ybanes to take with him to
Jamaica, and she was informed by said Caleb's Wife that in Effect they
did go with him, but does not know if they went away by Day or by
Night, as they did not Lodge in the Deponents House but on board the
Long Boat and only came there once a Day to carry provision, which was
Considered to be for Ybanes's Schooner, which he declared was so when
he Returned to this City and said that the English Privateer Carried
them on board as being Subjects of G't Britain.</p>

<p>6. To the Sixth she said that she only knows Antonio Correa, whose
Employ is that of a Mariner, but is Ignorant what Voyage he made in
the year and at the time mentioned or in what Vessel.</p>

<p>7. To this she said that she knows nothing of what is Contained in
this Enquiry.</p>

Interest from the Decission of this Cause and that what she has

declared that it Appears to their Lordships that upon the Case laid
before the Judge below by the Respondent himself the Capture of the
Effects in Question ought to have been deemed Piratical, that the
Respondent ought to have been prosecuted for the same and the Effects
Secured and that the Proceedings were Irregular and Illegal and the
Sentence of Condemnation of the Thirty first March 1757 Appeald from
Unjust and Warranted by no Collour of Proof. Therefore their Lordships
By their Final Decree or Sentence Reversed the same and Decreed the
Ten Doubleoons, five thousand seven hundred and sixty four Dollars,
one hundred and five Pistreens, one Bracelet, Twenty Gold Rings, the
Silver Buckles and Small Silver, Six Swivel Guns and Shott, one Cask
of Powder and Cutlasses and one Bag of Indigo to be Restored or the
Value thereof to be paid to the Claimant, and Condemned the Captor in

<p>To all who shall examine these letters, we, the burgomasters and
schepens of the city of Rotterdam in the county of Holland, signify
and declare, of certain truth, that Peter Lagerboom, citizen of
Amsterdam, master of this ship called the <i>Dageroed</i>, of about 150
lasts burden,<a name="FNanchor_2_1355" id="FNanchor_2_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1355" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> has loaded his wares, with which the ship is
freighted, upon her in this town, in order to transport them, with a
favorable wind, to the West Indies, as the said master and the
officers of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span> said ship have declared to us, asking from us a
let-pass and clearance, by which foreigners may be assured that this
city is not infested by a plague or any other contagious disease.
Since certainly it is a part of our official duty to meet the needs of
our citizens and to offer testimony to the truth, especially for those
who ask it of us, we assure all those to whose care this matter
belongs, that through the goodness of God Almighty this city is not
infected with the plague or any other deadly disease; and accordingly
we desire that those who are requested should accord to this master,
together with his ship, his shipmates and goods, free transit and the
opportunity to carry on traffic freely by land and sea, and should
prohibit that any hindrance should be offered to him in this matter,
nay rather that they should aid him, when his needs require it;
whereby they will lay us under strict obligations to render to them
the same good offices. In testimony whereof we have caused these
letters to be provided with our seal which we use publicly for
business,<a name="FNanchor_3_1356" id="FNanchor_3_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1356" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and signed by the hand of our secretary, on the ninth day

a French Snow of 150 Tons, with 18 Men, who made but little
Resistance, having but 2 Guns, and no one killed or wounded on either
side: The Privateer return'd with her Prize to Bristol the 15th,
having finished this Cruize in 3 Weeks to an Hour. The Cargo of the
Snow consists of 200 Hogsheads of Sugar, a Quantity of Coffee, Indigo,
Elephants-Teeth, Logwood, etc. and was bound from St. Domingo for
Old-France.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Privateer Ship <i>Hertford</i>, commanded by Capt. Thomas
Lewis, lately fitted out from this Place, brought into our Harbour a
valuable French Prize, a Ship of about 240 Tuns, which he took about
three Weeks ago, to the Southward of Bermudas in Lat. 29: She was
bound from Porto Prince in Hispaniola to old France; her Cargo is said
to consist of 400 Hogsheads of Sugar, and a considerable Quantity of
Indigo, Cotton-Wool, Hides, etc. valued at about 9000&pound; Sterling. She
sail'd out with 4 other Vessels bound also to France, and had parted
from her a Day or Two before she was taken: One of which is the Prize
carried into Bristol as beforementioned; and another of them is said
to be the trading Sloop that was seized at Rhode-Island last Week. Two
other Vessels, they say, sail'd the Day before them for Cape-Breton.</p>

<p>Several French Letters found on board this Prize con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>firm the Arrival
of the Squadron mentioned in our last, commanded by Monsieur
Beaufremont;<a name="FNanchor_4_1360" id="FNanchor_4_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1360" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and that he had sent out two Frigates to clear the

they ran into Porto Paix,<a name="FNanchor_5_1361" id="FNanchor_5_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1361" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and informed the French Admiral thereof;
who thereupon put to Sea, and a great Number of Cannon were heard for
several Hours; so that we may expect to hear of some smart Engagement.</p>

English Merchant men, who captivated her on the High Seas in March
last, tho they had neither Letters of Marque nor other Commission.</p>

<p>After her Arrival in Port, she was seized first by a Privateer, and
then by the <i>Southerland</i> Man of War, who both claim her as their
Property respectively.</p>

<p>Colonel Morris, the Judge of the Vice-Admiralty, apprehending that the
Lords of the Admiralty might be interested, issued a Warrant, by which
the Snow was taken into the Custody of the Marshal of that Court; and
as their Lordships have as yet appointed neither Proctor nor Advocate
in this, and the Colonies of Connecticut and New Jersey, his Honour
the Commissary was pleased on this Occasion to assign Council (as you
will perceive by the inclosed) to examine into the Affair, and
prosecute on their Lordships Behalf.</p>

<p>We have accordingly interposed a Libel for that Purpose, and let me
beg the Favour of you, to wait upon their Lordships, for an authentic
Copy of their Patent, and such Information, as may be thought proper
to be transmitted.</p>

<p>Whether their Lordships, in Case of a Sentence in their Favour, will
be pleased to consider the Captors, or chuse rather to reserve the
Prize to themselves, I conceive it will be necessary, that a proper
Power be sent over; of which you will be so good as to put their
Lordships in Mind; and whatever Directions and Papers are given into
your Hands, please to forward them with the utmost Dispatch to,</p>

Judge Hough, from the papers relating to it in the files of the New
York vice-admiralty court). On March 22, 1757, this French snow of 160
tons, while on a trading voyage from Port Louis in Guadeloupe to
Bordeaux, was captured off Bermuda by the English ship <i>Maxwell</i>,
Etherington master, and the New York sloop <i>St. Stephen</i>, Thomas, who
sent her with an English crew to New York; but neither of them had any
letters of marque, or commission authorizing them to take prizes. The
snow was brought to anchor inside Sandy Hook. Early in the morning of
April 6, John Crew, captain of the New York privateer <i>Fox</i>, came
aboard from a small boat with a few men, and took possession. Later,
the snow was taken over by the <i>Sutherland</i> man-of-war. Thus, the
<span xml:lang="fr"><i>Bon Rencontre</i></span> was without doubt a captured enemy vessel, but the captors
had not been authorized privateers, and the authorized privateer and
the king's ship had not made the capture. Under these circumstances
the admiralty judge, Lewis Morris, ordered the marshal to take custody
of the snow, and appointed Benjamin Nicoll and William Smith, jr., the
writer of this letter (see <a href="#DOC_188">doc. no. 188</a>, <a href="#Footnote_13_1335">note 13</a>), to be advocates for
the Lords of the Admiralty, whose interests seemed to him to be
involved. Thus there were four parties claiming&mdash;the original captors,
Crew, the King, and the Admiralty. April 7 the snow was libelled on
behalf of the Admiralty. Later, Etherington withdrew and Crew's claim
was ruled out, but as between the King and the Admiralty Judge Lewis
Morris gave no decision before his death in 1762. His successor, Judge
Richard Morris, gave judgment Aug. 10, 1764, but it has not been
preserved.</p></div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Rhode Island</span> January 15, 1759.</p>

<p><i>Sir</i>,</p>

<p>You may remember that near a Year ago I wrote you by Order of the
General Assembly to endeavor to procure a Judge of the Court of Vice
Admiralty to be appointed within and for this Colony.<a name="FNanchor_2_1367" id="FNanchor_2_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1367" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And as you
very soon finished that Affair successfully, a Judge being appointed
and commissioned, so he hath been accordingly sworn into his Office.
Notwithstanding this being so far done, yet there appears to be a
Deficiency of the Officers of that Court, as no Register or Marshal
have been appointed. It is true there hath commonly been a Deputy
Register in this Colony appointed by a Principal living in Boston at a
great Distance from the Colony, and within another Jurisdiction, which
seems incompatible, and it is solely at his Option, whether he will
appoint a Deputy to attend in this Colony or not, the Inconvenience of
which is obvious at the first View: And it doth not appear that any
Commission hath been given for a Marshal of the Court of Vice
Admiralty in this Colony since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span> one Mr. Gibbs was appointed to that
Office who hath been dead many years.<a name="FNanchor_3_1368" id="FNanchor_3_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1368" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The General Assembly, sensible of the great Inconveniences and
Mischiefs likely to attend the Want of those Officers, as you will see
by their Vote accompanying this Letter, have directed me in their
Behalf to desire you immediately to make proper Application to the
Lords of the Admiralty, and use your utmost Endeavours to obtain a
Register and Marshal of the Court of Vice Admiralty to be appointed
and commissioned for this Colony.<a name="FNanchor_4_1369" id="FNanchor_4_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1369" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> You will also perceive by the
aforesaid Vote of the General Assembly that they desire the Office of
Register may be obtained for Mr. Thomas Vernon,<a name="FNanchor_5_1370" id="FNanchor_5_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1370" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and that of Marshal
for Mr. William Mumford,<a name="FNanchor_6_1371" id="FNanchor_6_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1371" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who have been the acting Persons in those
two Offices in this Colony for near Twenty Years past, and have each
in their several Duties of Office conducted themselves unblameably,
and in all other Respects maintained unblemished Characters.</p>

<p>I am certain it must be needless for me to say any Thing further of
this Matter, since you will have the General Assembly's Order
concerning it, which must have infinitely Greater Weight in urging you
to prosecute this Affair, with Zeal and Dispatch, than any Thing I
could say.</p>

<p>In Behalf of the Colony and for myself, with great Regards I subscribe</p>

Stephen Hopkins (1707-1785), celebrated as a governor of Rhode Island
(1755-1757, 1758-1762, 1763-1765, 1767-1768) and a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, was at this time governor. The letter is
a duplicate bearing an original signature. It was addressed to Richard
Partridge, agent in London for the colony from 1715 to 1759. He dying
March 5, 1759, receipt of this letter is acknowledged by his executor,
Joseph Sherwood, May 11; letter in Miss Kimball's <i>Correspondence of
the Colonial Governors of Rhode Island</i>, II. 289. Sherwood, appointed
agent as Partridge's successor, pursued the general assembly's
request, but apparently without success, the Lords of the Admiralty
thinking it unnecessary to appoint a register and marshal in Rhode
Island, when there were already such officers in Massachusetts;
<i>ibid.</i>, II. 289, 293, 298, 304, 306.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_1367" id="Footnote_2_1367"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_1367">[2]</a> By vote of the assembly, <i>R.I. Col. Rec.</i>, VI. 107,
passed at the October session of 1757, Stephen Hopkins was instructed
to write to London requesting the appointment of a vice-admiralty
judge especially for Rhode Island, and recommending Col. John Andrews
to be the person. He wrote to Partridge, who on May 13, 1758,
acknowledges receipt of the letter, Kimball, <i>Corr. Govs. R.I.</i>, II.
273, and on May 24 announces his success, <i>ibid.</i>, II. 275, where also
is printed the warrant of the Lords of the Admiralty to Sir Thomas
Salusbury, judge of the High Court of Admiralty, to issue a commission
to Andrews. Thus Rhode Island was taken out of the jurisdiction of
Chambers Russell, vice-admiralty judge at Boston, who is commonly said
to have been judge for all southern New England from 1750 to 1767.
Andrews remained judge till the Revolution.</p></div>

March 10, 1762, and the list of commissions, were enclosures in the
note of Aug. 26, 1772. The writer, Samuel Seddon, was solicitor to the
Admiralty. John Clevland, to whom the earlier letter was addressed,
was secretary to that body from 1751 to 1763; Philip Stephens, from
1763 to 1795. For these commissions to try pirates, see <a href="#DOC_51">doc. no. 51</a>,
<a href="#Footnote_2_386">note 2</a>, and <a href="#DOC_106">doc. no. 106</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_751">note 1</a>. The death of George II. and the
accession of George III., 1760, made necessary the issue of new
commissions. The persons included in the commission were, in each
case, the governor, the vice-admiral, flag-officers, and
commander-in-chief of any squadron within the admiralty jurisdiction
of the colony, its lieutenant-governor and council, the chief civil
judge, the judge of the vice-admiralty, the captains and commanders of
royal ships within the jurisdiction, the secretary of the colony, the
surveyor general of customs, and the collector of plantation duties.

and lawful Right and Prize-Money, and not be kept out of their Money

appointed to manage the Affairs of the said Cruize.</p>

<p>XVI. That if it should happen, that the said Briganteen, by Means of
any Fight, Attack, or Engagement, be lost, sunk or disabled, so as she
may be thereby rendered unfit for any further Service as a private
Vessel of War to cruize; that then, and in such Case, the owner of
said Brigantine, shall be entitled to take to himself, and for his own
sole Use and Property, any Ship or Vessel taken during the Cruize,
with her Guns, Tackle, Furniture, Ammunition and Apparel, not
exceeding the Value of the Brigantine at the Time of her Sailing;
which Ship or Vessel so taken shall be to the Owner in Lieu of the
said Brigantine.</p>

<p>XVII. That in Case of the Death of the Commander, the next in Place
shall strictly observe and comply with the Rules, Orders, Restrictions
and Agreements, between the owner of the said Brigantine and the said
Commander.</p>
